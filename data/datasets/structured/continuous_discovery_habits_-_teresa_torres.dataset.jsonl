Everyone is looking to you for answers. How\ndo you come up with the right answers more often? If you’re like me, you’ve\nsearched all over, looking for a guide that can tell you how to do great product\ndiscovery. Most books promise a whole lot---plenty of the “what” but little of the\n“how.” You are often left wondering what to do next.\n\nEventually my team and I got the opportunity to go through the Continuous\nDiscovery Habits coaching program, which lays out the key elements of an end-toend modern product discovery approach (the same approach you’ll learn in this\nbook). The curriculum covers how to set outcomes, uncover customer problems,\nprioritize, come up with creative solutions, test assumptions quickly, and a lot\nmore. What did we gain from practicing the habits, and what can you expect to\ngain from reading this book?\n\nWe went from chopping and changing our discovery approach and needing\nlots of meetings to work out what to do next to a more structured discovery\nprocess. People knew what was expected of them and delivered more consistent\nresults.\n\nWe shifted away from a more superficial understanding of our customers.\nInstead of relying on heavy, infrequent research, we developed a deeper\nunderstanding of the customer’s needs, problems, and desires through regular\ncontact and lightweight research methods.\n\nWe shifted away from having lists of metrics to increase and outputs to deliver.\nNow we have fewer goals, more clarity, and a focus on solving the customer’s\nproblem in ways that drive business value.", "source_file": "Continuous_Discovery_Habits_-_Teresa_Torres.pdf", "extraction_method": "pdfminer", "ocr_used": false, "has_table": false, "chapter_num": null, "chapter_title": null, "section_num": null, "section_title": null}

{"segment_id": "00011", "page_num": 11, "segment": "INTRODUCTION\n\nIt was 2013. I was leading a product and design team at a venture-backed startup\nin San Francisco. We were developing a product that created real value for our\ncustomers. It was a noble cause---we helped college students find their first job out\nof college. In our discovery, we uncovered a key insight that had the potential to\ndisrupt our industry (more on that in Chapter 11). I had a partner, our head of\nengineering, who was a dream to work with. We became fast friends. I was\nmentoring a young designer whom I had known since she was nine years old---the\ndaughter of a good friend of mine. I encouraged a young engineer, a recent math\nmajor from the University of Washington, to get up to speed with machine\nlearning. I was relying on him to help us realize our product vision and was thrilled\nthat, as a company, we were investing in young talent. I loved coming to work each\nday. And then one day, I walked in and quit.\n\nI was tired. Not from the typical startup rat race. We weren’t working long\nhours, rushing from release to release, moving fast and breaking things (like the\nearly Facebook adage). By the time I joined, the company had grown out of the\nspeed-at-all-costs startup stage (if it ever had one). Instead, I was tired of the dayto-day reality of evangelizing product management at yet another founder-led\nstartup. I was tired of sitting in conference rooms arguing with executives about our\nproduct strategy when I was the only one who had spent time with our customers. I\nwas tired of debating with sales reps about why we weren’t going to build every\nfeature that prospects requested. I was tired of having to convince my colleagues\nthat a relentless focus on customers was a better strategy than obsessing about our\ncompetitors. Sadly, this is the work of a product executive.\n\nI was lucky. As an undergraduate, I was exposed to human-centered design at\nStanford University. I graduated and naively thought business would be human\ncentered. I spent the first 14 years of my career continuously disappointed that this\nwasn’t the case. And in 2013, I had had enough.

Instead, I took some time to reflect on how I could\nhave a bigger impact, and I realized that companies fell into the trap of chasing the\nnext sale or obsessing about their competitors because many companies (especially\nstartups) didn’t have a better model for product management. They didn’t know\nwhat good looked like.\n\nSo I didn’t just walk away from a job that day. I walked into my next career as\na product-discovery coach. For the past seven years, I’ve been teaching product\nteams how to create successful products by obsessing about customer needs, pain\npoints, and desires. I started with one-on-one product-manager coaching. I quickly\nlearned that it wasn’t enough to develop product managers, and my coaching\nevolved to teaching product managers, designers, and engineers how to make team\ndecisions about what to build. With time, I came to view my coaching curriculum\nas a product in and of itself, and I started to measure the impact of how I coached.\nI tracked cohorts, I measured where teams got stuck, I iterated on my methods.\nOver time, my curriculum got better, and, as a result, the product teams that I\nworked with got better.

How do you ensure that you are improving it over time? How do you\nguarantee that your team is creating value for your customers in a way that creates\nvalue for your business? In this book, you’ll learn a structured and sustainable\napproach to continuous discovery that will help you answer each of these\nquestions, giving you the confidence to act while also preparing you to be wrong.\nYou’ll learn to balance action with doubt, so that you can get started without being\nblindsided by what you don’t get right.\n\nLet’s start at the beginning. All product teams do a set of activities to decide\nwhat to build and then do a different set of activities to build and deliver it. While\nyou’ll learn that these activities can and should overlap and interweave with each\nother, the work that is required to do each is fundamentally different. In this book,\nI’ll refer to the work that you do to decide what to build as discovery and the work\nthat you do to build and ship a product as delivery.1 This distinction matters. As\nyou’ll see, many companies put a heavy emphasis on delivery---they focus on\nwhether you shipped what you said you would on time and on budget---while\nunder-investing in discovery, forgetting to assess if you built the right stuff. This\nbook aims to correct for that imbalance.\n\nDiscovery isn’t a one-time activity. A digital product is never done. It can and\nshould continue to evolve. As we learn more about our market, as our customers’\nneeds change, as new technology becomes available, good products adapt. This\nbook will introduce a continuous discovery framework that enables teams to\ndiscover brand-new products and to iterate on existing ones. It will help you\ncontinuously discover unmet customer needs and the solutions that will address", "source_file": "Continuous_Discovery_Habits_-_Teresa_Torres.pdf", "extraction_method": "pdfminer", "ocr_used": false, "has_table": false, "chapter_num": null, "chapter_title": null, "section_num": null, "section_title": null}

Before we get into how to do this, let’s take a brief look at how we got\nhere.\n\nThe Evolution of Modern Product Discovery\n\nProduct management is quickly evolving. Over the past 30 years, with the rise\nof the Internet, our industry has seen a rapid evolution in how we do both\ndiscovery and delivery. As a result, we see tremendous variation in our practice.\nProduct management looks different everywhere. A brief history of the evolution of\nmodern discovery can help us understand why this variation still exists. It can also\ngive us a clear picture of how we can improve, wherever we are in the progression.\nFor many years, traditional discovery was not done by the product team. In the\nearly days of software, business leaders owned discovery---they decided what to\nbuild. Discovery happened once a year in an annual budgeting process, where\nprojects with fixed timelines were assigned to specific engineering teams. A project\nmanager managed the work, budget, and schedule. Sometimes a product manager\ntranslated business needs to product requirements, but not always. There were\n(and still are) many challenges with this way of working. Software development is\nunpredictable. Projects were often delivered late and over budget. Business needs\noften trumped customer needs. Teams learned after the product shipped that\ncustomers weren’t excited about what they built. This way of working led to a lot\nof waste. Sadly, I still meet many teams and companies that work this way. Marty\nCagan refers to these types of teams as delivery teams.2\n\nFortunately, in 2001, a group of engineers got fed up, went into the\nmountains, put their heads together, and came up with the Agile manifesto. This\ngroup of software engineers, influenced by the broader industry discussion about\nthe pain points of developing software, proposed a number of principles to correct\nfor what they saw. Projects were too big. Teams spent way too much time building\nthe wrong stuff before they learned that customers didn’t want it. The authors of\nthe Agile manifesto advocated for shorter cycles with more frequent customer\nfeedback. Second, they proposed working at a pace that could be sustained\ncontinuously, rather than furiously scurrying from one milestone to another. Third,\nthey advocated for maximum flexibility---having the ability to adapt to customer\nfeedback quickly and easily. And fourth, they advocated for simplicity. They were", "source_file": "Continuous_Discovery_Habits_-_Teresa_Torres.pdf", "extraction_method": "pdfminer", "ocr_used": false, "has_table": false, "chapter_num": null, "chapter_title": null, "section_num": null, "section_title": null}

You’ll see\nthese four principles infused throughout the methods in this book.\n\nIn the years following the Agile manifesto, teams worked to adopt these\nprinciples. We saw a rise in the adoption of Scrum and Kanban, two popular\nAgile frameworks, to manage delivery work. In parallel, we saw the growth of\nuser-experience design and user research as means for collecting customer\nfeedback. But this way of working also ran into challenges.\n\nLeaders struggled to give up ownership of discovery. Even with shorter cycles\nand more customer feedback, business stakeholders still clung to their original\nideas. Most teams weren’t very good at estimating unpredictable work (who is?),\nand their shorter cycles, aptly named sprints in Scrum, truly became biweekly\nsprints, killing any chance of finding a continuously sustainable pace. The rest of\nthe business continued operating on an annual budgeting cycle, making true\nflexibility nearly impossible. When teams learned something wouldn’t work, they\nwere still expected to deliver it on time and under budget. Usability testing was\noften done too late in the process, making it hard to address the substantial issues\nthat were so often uncovered. User research was often outsourced to design\nagencies who did project-based research. And finally, teams continued to be\nmeasured by what they delivered, not whether anyone used it or if it created any\nvalue for the customer or the business.\n\nHowever, it wasn’t all bad news. Teams did shorten their delivery cycles.\nCompanies iterated from annual releases to quarterly releases to monthly releases.\nToday, many teams work on a weekly or even daily release schedule. More\nfrequent releases meant we could measure the impact of what we were building\nsooner. We got better at instrumenting our products. We got better at usability\ntesting our solutions. We got better at starting small and iterating to bigger\nsolutions. These were giant steps in the right direction. But we still struggled with\ndeciding what to build. We still learned, after shipping code, that we’d built the\nwrong stuff.\n\nMore instrumentation, however, did make us acutely aware of this problem.\nWe could now measure when we released a feature that nobody used, when we\nredesigned our navigation and our metrics didn’t move, and when we added a\nproduct to our portfolio that nobody bought. These were hard lessons to learn.\nBut the upside was that we started to question how we made decisions about what", "source_file": "Continuous_Discovery_Habits_-_Teresa_Torres.pdf", "extraction_method": "pdfminer", "ocr_used": false, "has_table": false, "chapter_num": null, "chapter_title": null, "section_num": null, "section_title": null}

Instead of just validating our\nideas at the end of discovery, we started co-creating with customers from the very\nbeginning. And our discovery cadence started to change. As our delivery cycles\ngot shorter, so, too, did our discovery cycles. And this is where we are today.\n\nToday, many teams are adopting, developing, and iterating on their own\ncontinuous discovery practices. They are engaging with customers on a regular\nbasis. They are testing their assumptions. Rather than just validating their ideas,\nthey are co-creating with customers---combining the team’s knowledge of what’s\ntechnically possible with the customer’s knowledge of their own needs, pain points,\nand desires to build better products. They are doing all of this on a continuous\ncadence, supporting the continuous development of their products. They are\nadapting to changes in the market, in customer needs, and in technology, in real\ntime. So can you. This book will show you how.\n\nWho This Book Is For\n\nMost successful digital products today are conceived, designed, built, and\ndelivered by a cross-functional team composed of product managers, designers,\nand software engineers. Product managers bring the business context---they help\nteams ensure that the products they are building are viable for the business. They\nensure that the business that supports the product will survive over time, allowing\nthe team to further satisfy customers’ needs. Designers bring visual, interactive,\nand systems-design chops that help to ensure that customers will understand how\nto best use a product and delight in that use. Software engineers bring the\ntechnical chops to ensure that the product is reliable, stable, and delivers on its\npromise. All three roles are critical to the success of any digital product. They are\ncollectively responsible for ensuring that their products create value for the\ncustomer in a way that creates value for the business.\n\nThis book was written for product people (product managers, designers,\nand software engineers) who want to build products that their customers need and", "source_file": "Continuous_Discovery_Habits_-_Teresa_Torres.pdf", "extraction_method": "pdfminer", "ocr_used": false, "has_table": false, "chapter_num": null, "chapter_title": null, "section_num": null, "section_title": null}

It outlines a collection of habits that, when deployed continuously week over\nweek, lead to better business outcomes and better customer outcomes. These\nhabits were designed to be adopted by a product trio composed of each of these\nroles. Throughout the book, the term “product trio” will refer to a product\nmanager, a designer, and a software engineer working together to develop products\nfor their customers.\n\nNow, most digital products require the input of more than three people. Most\nteams have several engineers contributing to the code base. Some teams have the\nluxury of having multiple designers or product managers contributing to the same\nproduct or unit of work. Additionally, most teams have other roles that contribute\nto the success of their product, including product marketers, data analysts, user\nresearchers, and customer-success representatives, among others. Defining the\nproduct trio as I have done here is not meant to exclude any of these critical roles\nfrom the discovery process.

For most teams, their trio needs to\nconsist of at least a product manager, designer, and software engineer. For some\nteams it will make sense to add a fourth or even a fifth member to this decisionmaking squad. I trust you will use your best judgment to find what works best for\nyour team.\n\nAnd if you don’t work in a product trio right now, don’t worry---you can still\nadopt many of these habits today. But this book will encourage you to start\nthinking about how you can more closely collaborate with your cross-functional\ncolleagues.\n\nWith your trio defined, let’s turn to the mindsets you’ll each need to develop in\n\norder to successfully adopt these continuous discovery habits.\n\nThe Prerequisite Mindsets\n\nMany teams chase frameworks, tools, and methodologies, hoping that each\nnew innovation will suddenly unlock the door to product success. However, for\nmost frameworks, tools, and methodologies to be successful, it’s not just your\ntactics that need to change but also your mindset. The same will be true for the\ntactics in this book. There are six mindsets that must be cultivated to successfully\nadopt the habits outlined in this book.\n\n1. Outcome-oriented: The first mindset is both a mindset and a habit.\nYou’ll learn more about the habit in the coming chapters, but the mindset requires\nthat you start thinking in outcomes rather than outputs. That means rather than\ndefining your success by the code that you ship (your output), you define success\nas the value that code creates for your customers and for your business (the\noutcomes). Rather than measuring value in features and bells and whistles, we\nmeasure success in impact---the impact we have had on our customers’ lives and\nthe impact we have had on the sustainability and growth of our business.\n\n2. Customer-centric: The second mindset places the customer at the center\nof our world. It requires that we not lose sight of the fact (even though many\ncompanies have) that the purpose of business is to create and serve a customer. We", "source_file": "Continuous_Discovery_Habits_-_Teresa_Torres.pdf", "extraction_method": "pdfminer", "ocr_used": false, "has_table": false, "chapter_num": null, "chapter_title": null, "section_num": null, "section_title": null}
{"segment_id": "00020", "page_num": 20, "segment": "elevate customer needs to be on par with business needs and focus on creating\ncustomer value as well as business value.\n\n3. Collaborative: The third mindset requires that you embrace the crossfunctional nature of digital product work and reject the siloed model, where we\nhand off deliverables through stage gates. Rather than the product manager\ndecides, the designer designs, and the engineer codes, we embrace a model where\nwe make team decisions while leveraging the expertise and knowledge that we each\nbring to those decisions.\n\n4. Visual: The fourth mindset encourages us to step beyond the comfort of\nspoken and written language and to tap into our immense power as spatial\nthinkers. The habits in this book will encourage you to draw, to externalize your\nthinking, and to map what you know. Cognitive psychologists have shown in study\nafter study that human beings have an immense capacity for spatial reasoning.3\nThe habits in this book will help you tap into that capacity.\n\n5. Experimental: The fifth mindset encourages you to don your scientificthinking hat. Many of us may not have scientific training, but, to do discovery well,\nwe need to learn to think like scientists identifying assumptions and gathering\nevidence. The habits in this book will help you develop and hone an experimental\nmindset.\n\n6. Continuous: And finally, these habits will help you evolve from a project\nmindset to a continuous mindset. Rather than thinking about discovery as\nsomething that we do at the beginning of a project, you will learn to infuse\ndiscovery continuously throughout your development process. This will ensure that\nyou are always able to get fast answers to your discovery questions, helping to\nensure that you are building something that your customers want and will enjoy.\n\nA Working Denition of Continuous Discovery\n\nIn my experience working with product teams, many are already adopting\nmany of the discovery activities you will learn about in this book. Customer\ninterviews, usability testing, and A/B testing are pervasive.

Several regulatory\norganizations uncovered fraudulent activity at the bank. Bankers were opening\nchecking, savings, and credit-card accounts on behalf of customers without their\ncustomers’ knowledge or prior approval. The news was picked up by newspapers\nacross the country. It was a public-relations nightmare.\n\nAt first, Wells Fargo blamed individual branch employees, arguing the\nfraudulent activity was the result of isolated behavior. But under further scrutiny, it\nbecame clear that employees were under immense pressure from senior leadership\nto grow the average number of accounts held by each customer. For years, Wells\nFargo was known for its cross-selling strategy, in which, once a customer opened\none account with the firm, bankers would then work to grow that customer’s\nfootprint. If the customer opened a checking and savings account, bankers would\noffer a credit card or a mortgage.\n\nWith time, however, this cross-selling strategy became more and more\naggressive.

Under immense pressure from senior leadership, tempted by the lure of\ncompelling incentives, many bankers opened fraudulent accounts on their\ncustomers’ behalf without their permission.\n\nWells Fargo was fined $185 million by the Consumer Financial Protection\nBureau and faced lawsuits costing them billions of dollars as a result. The Wells\nFargo story is a story of outcomes gone wrong. The company rightly started with a\ndesired outcome: To increase the average number of accounts per customer.\nHowever, they didn’t pair this outcome mindset with a customer-centric mindset,\nthat is critical for long-term product success.4\n\nWhile Wells Fargo’s fraud is exceptional, the focus on outcomes at the cost of\nthe customer is not uncommon. At many companies, there is a tension between\nbusiness needs and customer needs. When you get bombarded with a handful of\nads before you can start reading a newspaper article, it’s because the newspaper\nprioritized their need for ad revenue over the reader’s need for a pleasant reading\nexperience. When you can’t watch your favorite sporting event because the\nbroadcast rights didn’t allow it to be streamed in your region, the sports team\nprioritized their television revenue over their fans’ desire to watch the game. When\nhotels tack on a resort fee that isn’t visible at time of booking, the hotel is\nprioritizing their own short-term revenue needs over the traveler’s need for price\ntransparency. Sadly, this conflict between business needs and customer needs is\nprevalent in every industry. But it doesn’t have to be this way.\n\nBusinesses do need to make a profit. That’s required for their survival.\nHowever, profit should not come at the cost of serving the customer. Renowned\nbusiness consultant and author Peter Drucker, in the opening quote of this chapter,\nargues that the goal of a business is to “convert society’s needs into opportunities\nfor a profitable business.” He argues that a company’s purpose is to serve the\ncustomer. Instead of framing business needs as at odds with customer needs,\nDrucker is aligning the two, by arguing that serving customers is how we generate\nprofit. I couldn’t agree more.

{"segment_id": "00024", "page_num": 24, "segment": "Begin With the End in Mind\n\nAs our product-discovery methods evolve, we are shifting from an output\nmindset to an outcome mindset. Rather than obsessing about features (outputs),\nwe are shifting our focus to the impact those features have on both our customers\nand our business (outcomes). Starting with outcomes, rather than outputs, is what\nlays the foundation for product success.\n\nWhen a product trio is tasked with delivering an outcome, the business is\nclearly communicating what value the team can create for the business. And when\nthe business leaves it up to the team to explore the best outputs that might drive\nthat outcome, they are giving the team the latitude they need to create value for the\ncustomer. However, as we saw in the Wells Fargo story, we can’t take customer\nvalue for granted.\n\nWhen a product trio is tasked with an outcome, they have a choice. They can\nchoose to engage with customers, do the work required to truly understand their\ncustomers’ context, and focus on creating value for their customers. Or they can\ntake shortcuts---they can focus on creating business value at the cost of customers.\nThe organizational context in which the product trio works will have a big impact\non which choice the product trio will make.

The framework\nin this chapter and the habits described in this book will help you resolve the\ntension between business needs and customer needs so that you can create value\nfor your customers and your business.\n\nThe Challenge of Driving Outcomes\n\nMost product trios don’t have a lot of experience with driving outcomes. They\ngrew up in a world where they were told what to build. Or they were asked to\ngenerate outputs, with little thought for what impact those outputs had. So, when\nwe shift from an output mindset to an outcome mindset, we have to relearn how to\ndo our jobs.\n\nUnfortunately, it’s not as simple as talking to customers every week. That’s a\ngood start.

But they forget that\nthe purpose of these customer touchpoints is to conduct research in pursuit of a\ndesired outcome. Those last two lines of the definition are critical. We aren’t doing\nresearch for research’s sake. We are doing research so that we can serve our\ncustomers in a way that creates value for our business.\n\nFinding the best path to your desired outcome is what researchers call an “illstructured problem”---also commonly called a “wicked problem.” Ill-structured\nproblems are defined by having many solutions. There are no right or wrong\nanswers, only better or worse ones. Much of the work when tackling an illstructured problem is framing the problem itself.5 How we frame a problem has a\nbig impact on how we might solve it. For example, in the Wells Fargo story, their\nleadership, whether implicitly or explicitly, had framed the problem as “grow\ncustomer accounts at all costs.” This framing opened the door to cheating. If, on\nthe other hand, Wells Fargo had framed the problem as “create customers who\nwant to open more accounts,” bankers would have been less likely to cheat.\n\nIf product trios tasked with delivering a desired outcome want to pursue\nbusiness value by creating customer value, they’ll need to work to frame the\nproblem in a customer-centric way. They’ll need to discover the customer needs,\npain points, and desires that, if addressed, would drive their business outcome. For\nexample, if Wells Fargo had learned what inspired customers to open new\naccounts, they might have found a customer-centric way to reach their outcome.\n\nIn this book, I’ll refer to customer needs, pain points, and desires collectively\nas “opportunities”---they represent opportunities to intervene in our customers’\nlives in a positive way. Why don’t we call them “problems to solve”? In the\nproduct world, we don’t just solve customer problems. The word “problem”\nimplies something needs fixing.

I could try to\nshoehorn these desires into needs---I need something to fill my time, I need\nnutrients, and I need exercise. However, writing a book, eating spinach, and going\nto the gym might be more effective ways of addressing those needs. The key\ndifference here is that I enjoy Disneyland, ice cream, and mountain biking. These\nproducts were designed to address my desires, not solve my problems. So, to make\nsure this model is more inclusive of such products, I’ll use opportunities to\nrepresent customer needs, pain points, and desires collectively and the opportunity\nspace to represent the problem space as well as the desire space.\n\nTo reach their desired outcome, a product trio must discover and explore the\nopportunity space. The opportunity space, however, is infinite. This is precisely\nwhat makes reaching our desired outcome an ill-structured problem. How the team\ndefines and structures the opportunity space is exactly how they give structure to\nthe ill-structured problem of reaching their desired outcome. David Jonassen, an\neducational psychologist from the University of Missouri, studied ill-structured\nproblem-solving and highlights the importance of problem framing. How we frame\nan ill-structured problem impacts how we might solve it. Additionally, Jonassen\nsuggests that we can’t simply start with one framing. Instead, he argues, good\nproblem-solvers try out many framings, exploring how each impacts the solution\nspace.6\n\nThe implication for product trios is that two of the most important steps for\nreaching our desired outcome are first, how we map out and structure the\nopportunity space, and second, how we select which opportunities to pursue.\nUnfortunately, many product trios skip these steps altogether. They start with an\noutcome and simply start generating ideas. We do have to get to solutions---\nshipping code is how we ship value to our customers and create value for our\nbusiness. But the right problem framing will help to ensure that we explore and\nultimately ship better solutions.\n\nThe Underlying Structure of Discovery\n\nBack in 2016, I was coaching a product trio who were learning to adopt a\ncontinuous cadence for the first time.

It starts with defining a clear outcome---one\nthat sets the scope for discovery. From there, we must discover and map out the\nopportunity space---this is what gives structure to the ill-structured problem of\nreaching our desired outcome. It’s the all-important problem framing that opens up\nthe solution space. And finally, we need to discover the solutions that will address\nthose opportunities and thus drive our desired outcome.\n\nIt sounds simple, but this structure helps us know what to do when. I\n\nencourage teams to visualize it using an opportunity solution tree (OST).\n\nOpportunity solution trees are a simple way of visually representing the paths\n\nyou might take to reach a desired outcome.\n\nThe root of the tree is your desired outcome---the business need that reflects\n\nhow your team can create business value.", "source_file": "Continuous_Discovery_Habits_-_Teresa_Torres.pdf", "extraction_method": "pdfminer", "ocr_used": false, "has_table": false, "chapter_num": null, "chapter_title": null, "section_num": null, "section_title": null}

It’s easy to get lost. When you bounce from\ntactic to tactic, it’s easy to forget what you’ve learned and what decisions you need\nto make next.\n\nChip and Dan Heath, in their book Decisive, outline four villains of decisionmaking that lead to poor decisions. The first villain is looking too narrowly at a\nproblem. This is exactly why we want to explore multiple ways of framing the\nopportunity space. The second villain is looking for evidence that confirms our\nbeliefs. This is commonly known as confirmation bias. We’ll be discussing this bias\noften throughout the book. We’ll be exploring several habits that will help us\novercome this bias and ensure that we are considering both confirming and\ndisconfirming evidence. The third villain is letting our short-term emotions affect\nour decisions. In the product world, this often shows up when we fall in love with\nour ideas. The fourth villain is overconfidence. This, too, is common in the\nproduct world. We are often sure our ideas will be runaway successes.\n\nIn Decisive, the Heath brothers outline many tactics for overcoming the four\nvillains of decision-making, which is why it is the first book (after this one) that I\nrecommend all product managers read. But the one tactic we’ll rely on over and\nover again throughout this book is their advice to avoid “whether or not” decisions.\nA “whether or not” decision is when we frame a problem as “Should we do this or\nnot?” Product trios get caught up in “whether or not” decisions when we react to\none customer need or pain point at a time, asking, “Should we stop everything", "source_file": "Continuous_Discovery_Habits_-_Teresa_Torres.pdf", "extraction_method": "pdfminer", "ocr_used": false, "has_table": false, "chapter_num": null, "chapter_title": null, "section_num": null, "section_title": null}

This is especially true during times of stress, when we tend to fall back on\nold habits. As a result, it’s not enough for a product trio to make evidence-based\ndecisions about what to build; they also need to justify those decisions to key\nstakeholders along the way.\n\nUnfortunately, many teams struggle to get this right. When it comes to sharing\nwork with stakeholders, product trios tend to make two common mistakes. First,\nthey share too much information---entire interview recordings or pages and pages\nof notes without any synthesis---expecting stakeholders to do the discovery work\nwith them. Or second, they share too little of what they are learning, only\nhighlighting their conclusions, often cherry-picking the research that best supports\nthose conclusions. In the first instance, we are asking our stakeholders to do too\nmuch, and, in the second, we aren’t asking enough of them. The key to bringing\nstakeholders along is to show your work. You want to summarize what you are\nlearning in a way that is easy to understand, that highlights your key decision\npoints and the options that you considered, and creates space for them to give\nconstructive feedback. A well-constructed opportunity solution tree does exactly\nthis.\n\nWhen sharing your discovery work with stakeholders, you can use your tree to\nfirst remind them of your desired outcome. Next, you can share what you’ve\nlearned about your customer, by walking them through the opportunity space. The\ntree structure makes it easy to communicate the big picture while also diving into\nthe details when needed. Your tree should visually show what solutions you are\nconsidering and what tests you are running to evaluate those solutions.

Peter Drucker, a renowned managerial thought leader, wrote about its\nbenefits countless times12. Andy Grove, the former CEO of Intel, utilized the\npractice at Intel and wrote about it in his best-selling book High Output\nManagement.

Instead of asking them to\ndeliver a fixed roadmap full of features by a specific date in time, we are asking\nthem to solve a customer problem or to address a business need. The key\ndistinction with this strategy over traditional roadmaps is that we are giving the\nteam the autonomy to find the best solution. If they are truly a continuousdiscovery team, the product trio has a depth of customer and technology\nknowledge, giving them an advantage when it comes to making decisions about\nhow to solve specific problems.\n\nAdditionally, this strategy leaves room for doubt. A fixed roadmap\ncommunicates false certainty. It says we know these are the right features to build,\neven though we know from experience their impact will likely fall short. An\noutcome communicates uncertainty. It says, We know we need this problem solved,\nbut we don’t know the best way to solve it. It gives the product trio the latitude they\nneed to explore and pivot when needed. If the product trio finds flaws with their\ninitial solution, they can quickly shift to a new idea, often trying several before they\nultimately find what will drive the desired outcome.\n\nFinally, managing by outcomes communicates to the team how they should be\nmeasuring success. A clear outcome helps a team align around the work they\nshould be prioritizing, it helps them choose the right customer opportunities to\naddress, and it helps them measure the impact of their experiments. Without a\nclear outcome, discovery work can be never-ending, fruitless, and frustrating.\n\nAll of this sounds fantastic. Is managing by outcomes really as good as it\nsounds? This is a hard question to answer. Industry best practices are clear. The\nbest teams are adopting an outcome-focused mindset. However, the research is\nlimited and conflicting. In this chapter, we’ll start with what we can learn from\nindustry practice, and then we’ll look at how the research either supports or refutes\nthat practice.", "source_file": "Continuous_Discovery_Habits_-_Teresa_Torres.pdf", "extraction_method": "pdfminer", "ocr_used": false, "has_table": false, "chapter_num": null, "chapter_title": null, "section_num": null, "section_title": null}

If we\nchoose the wrong outcomes, we’ll still get the wrong results. When considering\noutcomes for specific teams, it helps to distinguish between business outcomes,\nproduct outcomes, and traction metrics. A business outcome measures how well\nthe business is progressing. A product outcome measures how well the product is\nmoving the business forward. A traction metric measures usage of a specific\nfeature or workflow in the product.\n\nBusiness outcomes start with financial metrics (e.g., grow revenue, reduce\ncosts), but they can also represent strategic initiatives (e.g., grow market share in a\nspecific region, increase sales to a new customer segment). Many business\noutcomes, however, are lagging indicators. They measure something after it has\nhappened. It’s hard for lagging indicators to guide a team’s work because it puts\nthem in react mode, rather than empowers them to proactively drive results. For\nSonja’s team, 90-day retention was a lagging indicator of customer satisfaction\nwith the service.

Therefore, we want to identify\nleading indicators that predict the direction of the lagging indicator.

Remember, product outcomes measure how well\nthe product moves the business forward. By definition, a product outcome is\nwithin the product trio’s span of control. Business outcomes, on the other hand,\noften require coordination across many business functions. For example, suppose\nSonja’s team discovered that, in addition to some customers not understanding the\nvalue of tailor-made dog food and some dogs not liking the food, poor customersupport response times and surprise price increases that occurred after their trial\nperiod ended also influenced their high churn rate. In this case, product,\nmarketing, and customer support might need to coordinate their efforts to increase\nretention.\n\nCoordination isn’t bad. In fact, most of the work that we do will require\ncoordination across teams. However, we can increase the accountability of each\nteam by assigning a metric that is relevant to their own work. In this example, we\nmight ask the product team to increase the number of dogs who like the food\n(something within the product team’s span of control), whereas we might ask the\nmarketing team to increase the transparency of the pricing after the trial ends, and\nwe might ask the customer-support team to decrease their average response times.\nAll three groups are contributing to the business outcome of increasing customer\nretention, but each is doing so in the way that they can best contribute.\n\nAssigning product outcomes to product trios increases a sense of responsibility\nand ownership.

If Sonja’s team\nbelieves more dogs would like the food if their owners had a better transition plan,\nwhy not get more specific with the outcome?

Product\noutcomes, generally, give product trios far more latitude to explore and will enable\nthem to make the decisions they need to ultimately drive business outcomes.\nHowever, there are two instances in which it is appropriate to assign traction\nmetrics to your team.\n\nFirst, assign traction metrics to more junior product trios. Improving a traction\nmetric is more of an optimization challenge than a wide-open discovery challenge\nand is a great way for a junior team to get some experience with discovery methods\nbefore giving them more responsibility.

Or, based on the\nstrategic needs of the business, the leader might refine this outcome to have the\nteam focus on specific breeds or strategic geographic regions. The key is that the\nleader should not narrow the scope so much that the team is tasked with a traction\nmetric---engagement with the transition calendar.\n\nThe product trio brings customer and technology knowledge to the\nconversation and should communicate how much the team can move the metric in\nthe designated period of time (usually one calendar quarter). The trio should not\nbe required to communicate what solutions they will build at this time, as this\nshould emerge from discovery.\n\nFor example, Sonja’s team, if asked to focus on a specific customer segment,\nmight summarize what they know about that customer segment, share how\nsuccessful past attempts to get dogs to like the food in that customer segment have\nbeen, and estimate how much impact they can have on the metric in the designated\ntime period (e.g., we can increase the number of dogs in that segment who like the\nfood by 10% in the next three months).\n\nThis then sets the stage for the two-way negotiation. If the business needs the\nteam to have a bigger impact on the outcome, the trio will need to adjust their\nstrategy to be more ambitious, and the product leader will need to understand that\nmore ambitious outcomes carry more risk. The team will need to make bigger bets\nto increase their chance of success, but these bigger bets typically come with a\nhigher chance of failure. Similarly, the product leader and product trio can\nnegotiate resources (e.g., adding engineers to the team) and/or remove competing\ntasks from the team’s backlog, giving them more time to focus on delivering their\noutcome.\n\nA particular scenario of note is when teams are assigned an outcome for the\nfirst time---as we saw in Sonja’s story. In these cases, the product trio will need\nsome time to learn what might move the metric. This is why a stable product trio\nfocused on the same outcome over time is so critical.

Teams also need continuous feedback on\ntheir progress toward their goal, supporting the argument that goals should be\nmeasurable.17\n\nHowever, much of this goal-setting research was conducted using simple,\nstraightforward tasks. More recent research on goal setting involving more complex\ntasks, like the ones product trios face, found that challenging goals can decrease\nperformance if the team doesn’t have strategies for how to achieve their goal.\nThese studies found that encouraging teams to “do their best” was more effective\nthan setting specific, challenging goals.

Most\nteams will have more of an impact by focusing on one outcome at a time.\n\nPing-ponging from one outcome to another.

Instead, set an outcome for your\nteam, and focus on it for a few quarters. You’ll be amazed at how much impact you\nhave in the second and third quarters after you’ve had some time to learn and\nexplore.\n\nSetting individual outcomes instead of product-trio outcomes.\nBecause product managers, designers, and software engineers typically report up,", "source_file": "Continuous_Discovery_Habits_-_Teresa_Torres.pdf", "extraction_method": "pdfminer", "ocr_used": false, "has_table": false, "chapter_num": null, "chapter_title": null, "section_num": null, "section_title": null}

This is most common at companies that tie outcomes to\ncompensation. However, it has a detrimental effect. The goal is for the product trio\nto collaborate to achieve product outcomes that drive business outcomes. This isn’t\npossible if each member is focused on their own goal. Instead of setting individual\noutcomes, set team outcomes.\n\nChoosing an output as an outcome. Shifting to an outcome mindset is\nharder than it looks. We spend most of our time talking about outputs. So, it’s not\nsurprising that we tend to confuse the two. Even when teams intend to choose an\noutcome, they often fall into the trap of selecting an output. I see teams set their\noutcome as “Launch an Android app” instead of “Increase mobile engagement”\nor “Get to feature parity on the new tech stack” instead of “Transition customer to\nthe new tech stack.” A good place to start is to make sure your outcome represents\na number even if you aren’t sure yet how to measure it. But even then, outputs can\ncreep in. I worked with a team that helped students choose university courses who\nset their outcome as “Increase the number of course reviews on our platform.”\nWhen I asked them what the impact of more reviews was, they answered, “More\nstudents would see courses with reviews.” That’s not necessarily true. The team\ncould have increased the number of reviews on their platform, but if they all\nclustered around a small number of courses, or if they were all on courses that\nstudents didn’t view, they wouldn’t have an impact. A better outcome is “Increase\nthe number of course views that include reviews.” To shift your outcome from less\nof an output to more of an outcome, question the impact it will have.\n\nFocusing on one outcome to the detriment of all else. Like we saw\nin the Wells Fargo story, focusing on one metric at the cost of all else can quickly\nderail a team and company. In addition to your primary outcome, a team needs to\nmonitor health metrics to ensure they aren’t causing detrimental effects elsewhere.\nFor example, customer-acquisition goals are often paired with customer-satisfaction\nmetrics to ensure that we aren’t acquiring unhappy customers.

If you\nstart jotting down everything you know about your customer, you’ll quickly get\noverwhelmed. Instead, start with your desired outcome. The trio in the opening\nstory was trying to increase application submissions, so they mapped out what they\nthought their customers’ experience was as they filled out the application. They\nspecifically focused on this question: “What’s preventing our customers from\ncompleting their application today?” Their outcome constrained what they tried to\ncapture.\n\nThink strategically about how broad or narrow to set the scope. When a team\nis focused on an optimization outcome, like increasing application submissions, it’s\nfine to define the scope narrowly. However, when working on a more open-ended\noutcome, you’ll want to expand the scope of your experience map.\n\nFor example, if we worked at a streaming-entertainment company (e.g.,\nNetflix, Hulu) and we were tasked with an outcome like “increase the average\nminutes watched,” we might set our scope broadly: “How do customers entertain\nthemselves today?” With this scope, we might capture everything we know about\nhow customers choose, engage with, and consume streaming entertainment. But\ngiven the scope of the question, we might also capture what we know about their\nbehavior when socializing with friends, attending sporting events and concerts,\nreading books, and playing video games. This might be the right scope, if we are\nlooking to explore adjacent markets. But for most teams, this scope is too broad.\n\nHowever, we don’t want to define our scope too narrowly, either. If we define\nour scope as “How do customers entertain themselves using our service?” we rule\nout any inspiration we might get from how they use other streaming-entertainment\nservices, how they entertain themselves through their cable or satellite-dish\npackages, or how they entertain themselves through services like Twitch and\nYouTube.

Groupthink occurs\nwhen a group of individuals underperform due to the dynamics of the group.\nThere are a number of reasons for this. When working in a group, it’s common for\nsome members to put in more effort than others; some group members may hesitate\nor even refrain from speaking up, and groups tend to perform at the level of the\nleast-capable member.19 In order to leverage the knowledge and expertise in our\ntrios, we need to actively work to counter groupthink.\n\nTo prevent groupthink, it’s critical that each member of the trio start by\ndeveloping their own perspective before the trio works together to develop a shared\nperspective. This is counterintuitive. It’s going to feel inefficient. We are used to\ndividing and conquering, not duplicating work. But in instances where it’s\nimportant that we explore multiple perspectives, the easiest way to get there is for\neach product-trio member to do the work individually.\n\nExperience Maps Are Visual, Not Verbal\n\nMany of us stopped drawing sometime in elementary school.

They are opportunities to intervene in your customers’ lives in a positive\nway.\n\nSteve Jobs knew the importance of discovering opportunities better than most.\nHe and the rest of the Apple team were masters at uncovering unmet needs.\nWhen the first iPhone was released in 2007, it wasn’t the first smartphone on the\nmarket. People resisted the idea of an on-screen keyboard. There were no thirdparty apps. But even though Apple wasn’t first to the market and they launched\nwith a limited feature set, the first iPhone solved several customer needs that other\nsmartphones didn’t.\n\nIf you are too young to remember the first iPhone, one of the big features at\nrelease was visual voicemail. Visual voicemail is so familiar today, it’s hard to\nremember what voicemail used to be like. Here’s how Ars Technica described\nvisual voicemail in their 2007 review:\n\nInstead of requiring the user to dial up the carrier’s voicemail number and\nlisten to his or her voicemails in the order that they were received, visual\nvoicemail lists each message out in visual format on the iPhone, almost like\ne-mail. It displays who the voicemail is from (and if it doesn’t recognize the\nnumber, it will analyze the area code and tell you what geographical area\nit’s from, which is helpful), and the user can tap whichever one in the list\nthat he or she wants, no matter its position in the list. When the voicemail is\nplaying, the user can pause it, scrub back and forth in the message, or\nskip.21\n\nNow, if you had interviewed customers before the original iPhone was\nreleased, nobody would have asked for visual voicemail. Nobody knew visual\nvoicemail was possible. Most people weren’t even aware of their own pain points\nand challenges with how regular voicemail worked.

If you had five messages and you needed to hear\nthe third message, you had to decide what to do with the first two messages before\nyou could get to the third one.\n\nVoicemail was tedious. We were so accustomed to the tedium that we no\nlonger noticed it. In fact, voicemail was a vast improvement over an earlier\ntechnology---tape-recorded answering machines. Early answering machines\nrequired that you be at home to check your messages. If you wanted to skip a\nmessage, you had to manually fast-forward and hope that you stopped in the right\nspot to hear the next message.\n\nVoicemail, on the other hand, allowed you to check your messages from\nanywhere. You could quickly skip from one message to the next. Jobs and his team,\nhowever, weren’t satisfied. While voicemail was better than early answering\nmachines, it still presented pain points and challenges for the end-user. Apple\nuncovered these opportunities and addressed them. Visual voicemail delighted\nconsumers.\n\nApple is secretive about the way they work, so it’s not clear if they interviewed\nusers, observed friends and family, or simply identified these opportunities based\non their own experience. But what is clear is that Apple is better than most at\ndiscovering opportunities.\n\nFor the rest of us, this chapter will cover how to use continuous interviewing to\nreliably find customer opportunities. As we saw with visual voicemail, we can’t\nalways rely on our customers to tell us what they need or want. Instead, you’ll\nlearn how to use your customers’ own stories to discover their unmet needs.\n\nThe Challenges With Asking People What They Need\n\nDuring a workshop, I asked a woman what factors she considered when\nbuying a new pair of jeans. She didn’t hesitate to answer. She said, “Fit is my\nnumber-one factor.” I then asked her to tell me about the last time she bought a\npair of jeans. She said, “I bought them on Amazon.” I asked, “How did you\nknow they would fit?” She replied, “I didn’t, but they were a brand I liked, and\nthey were on sale.”", "source_file": "Continuous_Discovery_Habits_-_Teresa_Torres.pdf", "extraction_method": "pdfminer", "ocr_used": false, "has_table": false, "chapter_num": null, "chapter_title": null, "section_num": null, "section_title": null}

Her second response tells me how she\nactually bought a pair of jeans. This is a crucial difference. She thinks she buys a\npair of jeans based on fit, but brand loyalty, the convenience of online shopping,\nand price (or getting a good deal) were more important when it came time to make\na purchase.\n\nThis story isn’t unique. I’ve asked people these same two questions countless\ntimes in workshops. The purchasing factors often vary, but there is always a gap\nbetween the first answer and the second. These participants aren’t lying. We just\naren’t very good at understanding our own behavior.\n\nDecades of research on investigative interviewing (the kind used by journalists,\nlawyers, and detectives) has shown that interview participants struggle to answer\ndirect (factual) questions accurately.22 In a witness interview, this might mean that\nthe participant mistakes the color of the getaway car or forgets an important\nlocation. In a customer interview, this might mean that the customer misremembers\nwhen they bought something or forgets why they signed up for a particular service.\nDirect questions require that we recall facts without context. This process is\nprone to cognitive biases---common patterns in mental errors that result from the\nway our brains process information.23 We are bad at quantifying how often we do\nsomething. We often speculate about what we did, when, and why. We tend to\nfavor generalities over specifics. We give answers that are influenced more by our\nsense of identity rather than our actual behavior. And we tend to come up with\ncoherent reasons to explain our behavior that are often not grounded in reality. To\nbe clear, this behavior is a function of how our brains work and not the result of\ninterview participants trying to deceive us. In fact, many of these biases come into\nplay because our interview subjects are trying to be helpful.\n\nWe see these errors show up in many contexts. Physically active adults\noverestimate how often they work out. Countless Americans underestimate how\nmuch alcohol they drink. The majority of us think we are above-average drivers,\nhealthy eaters, and great listeners. It gets worse. Like the woman buying jeans, we\nthink we understand why we do the things we do. But the reality is, our brains are\nexceptionally good at creating coherent (but not necessarily true) stories that\ndeceive us.", "source_file": "Continuous_Discovery_Habits_-_Teresa_Torres.pdf", "extraction_method": "pdfminer", "ocr_used": false, "has_table": false, "chapter_num": null, "chapter_title": null, "section_num": null, "section_title": null}
{"segment_id": "00066", "page_num": 66, "segment": "Michael Gazzaniga, a neuropsychologist at the University of California Santa\nBarbara, conducted a phenomenal study that shows just how effective our brains\nare at deceiving us.24 He constructed an experiment protocol in which split-brain\npatients were shown an image such that it was visible to only their left eye and\nasked the participant to select a related card with their left hand. Left-eye vision\nand left-side body movement are controlled by the right hemisphere. In a splitbrain patient, the connection between the right and left hemispheres has been\nsevered, meaning no information can cross from one hemisphere to the other.\nTherefore, in this protocol, the right hemisphere was doing all of the work, and the\nleft hemisphere was unaware of what was happening.\n\nGazzaniga then asked participants why they chose the card that they did.\nBecause language is processed and generated in the left hemisphere, the left\nhemisphere is required to respond. However, because of the protocol design, only\nthe right hemisphere knows why the participant selected the card. As a result,\nGazzaniga expected the participants to be stumped. But that isn’t what happened.\nInstead, every subject fabricated a response.\n\nThe left hemisphere was being asked to provide a rationalization for a\nbehavior done by the right hemisphere. The left hemisphere didn’t know the\nanswer. But that didn’t keep the left hemisphere from fabricating an answer. That\nanswer, however, had no basis in reality.\n\nNow if this study had been limited to split-brain patients, it would be\ninteresting but not very relevant to us. It turns out split-brain patients aren’t the\nonly ones who fabricate reasons. We all do it. Gazzaniga named this tendency to\nrationalize our behavior even when we can’t possibly know the reason as the “left\nbrain interpreter,” and later studies have shown that we all have an active “left\nbrain interpreter.”25 We need to reconcile the present with the past, and when\ninformation is missing, our brains simply fill in details that make the story\ncoherent.\n\nThis is exactly why in Thinking, Fast and Slow, behavioral economist Daniel\nKahneman claimed, “A remarkable aspect of your mental life is that you are rarely\nstumped.” Your brain will gladly give you an answer. That answer, however, may\nnot be grounded in reality. In fact, Kahneman outlines dozens of ways our brains\nget it wrong. It’s also why Kahneman argues confidence isn’t a good indicator of\ntruth or reality. He writes, “Confidence is a feeling, which reflects the coherence of\nthe information and the cognitive ease of processing it.” Not necessarily the truth.", "source_file": "Continuous_Discovery_Habits_-_Teresa_Torres.pdf", "extraction_method": "pdfminer", "ocr_used": false, "has_table": false, "chapter_num": null, "chapter_title": null, "section_num": null, "section_title": null}

Gazzaniga’s participants thought they knew why they\nselected the card that they did. The left-brain interpreter filled in the missing\ndetails, creating a coherent story. The participant was confident---and,\nunfortunately, wrong.\n\nGazzaniga’s study means you can’t simply ask your customers about their\nbehavior and expect to get an accurate answer. Most will obligingly give you what\nsounds like a reasonable answer. But you won’t know if they are telling you about\ntheir ideal behavior or their actual behavior. Nor will you know if they are simply\ntelling you a coherent story that sounds true but isn’t true in practice.\n\nI learned this the hard way. Back in 2007, I worked on a product that helped\ncorporate recruiters source candidates. At that time, the hype in the recruiting\nindustry was around recruiting passive candidates---candidates who were currently\nemployed but open to new opportunities. There was a belief (and probably still is\ntoday) that passive candidates were better than active candidates---those who were\nunemployed and ready to apply for jobs right now. Thought leaders in the\nrecruiting space advocated for recruiting passive candidates. Every customer I\ntalked to told me they wanted to source passive candidates. I thought we had\nuncovered a real need. So, we built a passive-candidate-recruiting solution. It\nflopped.\n\nCorporate recruiters said they wanted to source passive candidates. It’s what\ntheir ideal selves wanted. It’s what they aspired to. But when it came time to fill an\nopen position, they sourced active candidates again and again. Why did this\nhappen? Because recruiters are often measured by how fast they can fill an open\nrole, and active candidates are the fastest way to do that. Even though recruiters\naspired to source passive candidates, what they actually did was source active\ncandidates. It’s the equivalent of opening a salad bar across from a McDonald’s\nbecause customers said they wanted to eat healthier. We can’t be too surprised\nwhen our salads lose out to the Big Mac.\n\nOur failure wasn’t due to a lack of research. It was because we asked our\ncustomers the wrong questions. We built a product based on a coherent story told\nby both the thought leaders in our space and by our customers themselves. But it\nwasn’t a story that was based in reality.

In\nthe coming pages, you’ll learn a far more reliable method for learning about your\ncustomers’ actual behavior.\n\nDistinguish Research Questions From Interview\nQuestions\n\nThe key to interviewing well is to distinguish what you are trying to learn\n(your research questions) from what you ask in the interview (your interview\nquestions). Most product teams could generate an infinite list of research\nquestions. There is always more to learn about our customers. We see some teams\nsolve this by generating multi-page discussion guides. But this strategy assumes\nthat you’ll be talking to customers only occasionally, therefore, you need to ask\nthem everything right now. Instead, assume you’ll talk to customers every week,\nand focus on what you need to learn at this moment in time.\n\nIn any given interview, you’ll want to balance broadly exploring the needs,\npain points, and desires that matter most to that particular customer and diving\ndeep on the specific opportunities that are most relevant to you. Every customer is\nunique, and, no matter how well you recruit, you may find that your customer\ndoesn’t care about the opportunity you most need to learn about. We don’t want to\nspend time exploring a specific opportunity with a customer if that opportunity\nisn’t important to them. Our primary research question in any interview should be:\nWhat needs, pain points, and desires matter most to this customer?\n\nOnce we’ve explored the opportunities that matter most to the customer, we\ncan dive into the specifics of any of those opportunities. You may have specific\nopportunities in mind, but you’ll want to let your participant set the direction of\nthe interview. Remember, what matters most to your customer trumps what you\nneed to learn.\n\nSince we can’t ask our customers direct questions about their behavior, the best\nway to learn about their needs, pain points, and desires is to ask them to share", "source_file": "Continuous_Discovery_Habits_-_Teresa_Torres.pdf", "extraction_method": "pdfminer", "ocr_used": false, "has_table": false, "chapter_num": null, "chapter_title": null, "section_num": null, "section_title": null}

Memories about recent\ninstances are more reliable than our generalizations about our own behavior or our\nanswers to direct questions.\n\nInstead of asking, “What criteria do you use when purchasing a pair of\njeans?”---a direct question that encourages our participant to speculate about their\nbehavior---we want to ask, “Tell me about the last time you purchased a pair of\njeans.” The story will help us uncover what criteria our participant used when\npurchasing a pair of jeans, but because the answer is situated in a specific instance\n(an actual time when they bought jeans), it will reflect their actual behavior, not\ntheir perceived behavior.\n\nFinding the right story question can be challenging. The scope of the story\nthat you’ll want to elicit will change throughout your discovery process. For\nexample, if you work at a streaming-entertainment company and you are trying to\nincrease viewer engagement, you might ask, “Tell me about the last time you\nwatched our streaming-entertainment service.” This question will help you learn\nabout pain points and challenges with your product.\n\nBut you may want to widen the scope. You might say, “Tell me about the last\ntime you watched any streaming entertainment.” This question will elicit stories\nabout your product but also stories about your competitors. You could broaden the\nscope even further to, “Tell me about the last time you were entertained.” This\nmight elicit stories about going to a movie theater, attending a concert, socializing\nwith friends, and much more. This type of question is a great way to uncover what\nyour product category (e.g., streaming entertainment) competes with.\n\nYou’ll want to tailor the scope of the question based on what you need to learn\nat that moment in time. A narrow scope will help you optimize your existing\nproduct. Broader questions will help you uncover new opportunities. The broadest\nquestions might help you uncover new markets. The appropriate scope will depend\non the scope you set when creating your experience map (see Chapter 4).\n\nExcavate the Story\n\nAs the interviewer, you will have to work to excavate the story.

This means that each person spends roughly\n50% of the time talking. I say something, and then you say something. If I ask you\na short question, you are likely to respond with a short answer. As the interviewer,\nyou need to reset this expectation. One of the most effective ways to do this is to\ninform your participant that you would like them to share their full story with you,\nto share as many details as possible, to leave nothing out, and that, when they are\ndone with their story, you’ll ask for missing details.\n\nEven so, you may still have to dig to uncover the full story. You can use\ncommon storytelling tactics to help you do so. A good story has a protagonist who\nencounters experiences on a timeline. Temporal prompts are one of the most\neffective ways to guide the participant through their own story. You can ask, “Start\nat the beginning. What happened first?” You can use the experience map you\ncreated in Chapter 4 to help guide your participant. Prompt for the beginning of\nthe story. If your participant isn’t sure where to start, you can further prompt,\n“Where were you? Set the scene for me.” As the participant tells their story, you\ncan encourage them to keep going by asking them, “What happened next?”\nSometimes they might skip a few steps, and you may need to ask, “What\nhappened before that?” Thinking about their story as having a beginning, a\nmiddle, and an end can help you guide the participant. Use your customerexperience map to help you track their story. Listen for specific nodes. Ask about\nnodes that were left out of the story.\n\nStories also take place in specific locations; protagonists encounter challenges,\nand they receive help from supporting characters. Other characters might present\nobstacles or interfere with the protagonist’s progress. Keep these elements in mind\nas they’ll help you tease out what the participant forgets. You might ask, “Who\nwas with you?” “What challenges did you encounter?” “How did you overcome\nthat challenge?” “Did anyone help you?”\n\nYou’ll notice, as you excavate the story, that your participant will bounce back\nand forth between the story they are telling and generalizing about their behavior.\nYou might ask, “What challenges did you face?” and they may respond with, “I\nusually...” or, “In general, I have this challenge...” You’ll want to gently guide", "source_file": "Continuous_Discovery_Habits_-_Teresa_Torres.pdf", "extraction_method": "pdfminer", "ocr_used": false, "has_table": false, "chapter_num": null, "chapter_title": null, "section_num": null, "section_title": null}

It’s going to tempt\nyou to conclude that’s the real need, pain point, or desire. In those moments, it’s\ncritical that you remember the research on how poorly we perform at answering\ndirect questions and how susceptible our responses are to cognitive biases.\n\nKeep the interview grounded in specific stories to ensure that you collect data\nabout your participants’ actual behavior, not their perceived behavior. And\nremember, like most of the habits in this book, it takes practice. Don’t get\ndiscouraged. Keep at it. You will get better with time.\n\nYou Won’t Always Get What You Want\n\nWith story-based interviewing, you won’t always collect the story that you\nwant. That’s okay. The golden rule of interviewing is to let the participant talk\nabout what they care about most. You can steer the conversation in two ways.\n\nFirst, you decide which type of story to collect. You can ask a more open\nquestion like: “Tell me about the last time you watched streaming entertainment.”\nOr you can ask for a more specific story: “Tell me about the last time you watched\nstreaming entertainment on a mobile device.”\n\nSecond, you can use your story prompts to dig deeper into different parts of\nthe story. If you are primarily concerned with how they chose what to watch, dig\ninto that part of the story. If you aren’t particularly interested in what device they\nwatch on, don’t ask for that detail if they leave it out of their story. Let your\nresearch questions guide your story prompts.\n\nHowever, even so, you might encounter some participants who simply don’t\ncooperate. They might not have a relevant story.

Be sure to represent opportunities as needs and not solutions.\nIf the participant requests a specific feature or solution, ask about why they need\nthat, and capture the opportunity (rather than the solution). A good way to do this\nis to ask, “If you had that feature, what would that do for you?” For example, if an\ninterviewee says, “I wish I could just say the name of the movie I’m searching for,”\nthat’s a feature request. If you ask, “What would that do for you?” they might\nrespond, “I don’t want to have to type out a long movie title.” That’s the\nunderlying need. The benefit of capturing the need and not just the solution is that\nthe need opens up more of the solution space. We could add voice search to\naddress this need, but we also could auto-complete movie titles as they type.\n\nOpportunities don’t need to be exact quotes, but you should frame them using\nyour customer’s words.

To nurture your interviewing habit, interview at least\none customer every week.\n\nAutomate the Recruiting Process\n\nThe hardest part about continuous interviews is finding people to talk to. In\norder to make continuous interviewing sustainable, we need to automate the\nrecruiting process. Your goal is to wake up Monday morning with a weekly\ninterview scheduled without you having to do anything.\n\nSome teams have no problem recruiting interview participants, and they skip\nover this step. However, every team has weeks in which something goes wrong---a\nrelease goes awry, a significant prospect is at risk, a key team member is\nunexpectedly sick. It’s during these weeks (that happen far more often than we like\nto admit) that you’ll want to fall back on your recruitment automation to help you\nsustain your weekly interviewing habit.\n\nWhen a customer interview is automatically added to your calendar each\n\nweek, it becomes easier to interview than not to interview.

{"segment_id": "00077", "page_num": 77, "segment": "Recruit Participants While They Are Using Your\nProduct or Service\n\nThe most common and easiest way to find interview participants is to recruit\nthem while they are using your product or service. You can integrate a single\nquestion into the flow of your product: “Do you have 20 minutes to talk with us\nabout your experience in exchange for $20?” Be sure to customize the copy to\nreflect the ask-and-offer that works best for your audience. If the visitor answers\n“Yes,” ask for their phone number.\n\nThis strategy works best for high-traffic sites, where you can turn the survey on\nfor a few minutes and get a response right away. If you don’t have a high-traffic\nservice, it may take hours or even days to get your first response. In this case,\ninstead of asking for a phone number, ask the visitor to schedule an interview. Use\nscheduling software to reduce the back-and-forth required to find an available time.\nFor new products or services with few or no customers, you can still implement\nthis strategy. Instead of recruiting people while they use your product (as it may\nnot exist yet), you can use ads to drive traffic to a landing page. You can recruit\npeople directly from the landing page.\n\nAsk Your Customer-Facing Colleagues to Recruit\n\nMost companies have teams who are on the phone with customers day in and\nday out. This includes sales teams, account managers, customer-success teams,\nand customer-support teams.\n\nYou can work with these teams to help you recruit interview participants. The\neasiest place to start is to ask a customer-facing colleague if you can join one of\ntheir existing meetings. Start by asking for five minutes at the end of a call. You\nwant to make it as easy as possible for both your colleague and your customer to\nsay “Yes.” Use the last few minutes of an existing call to collect a specific story\nabout the customer.\n\nOnce your customer-facing teams are comfortable with you joining their\nmeetings, ask your customer-facing colleagues to help you schedule an interview\nwith one of their customers.

The key is to clearly communicate to\nyour customer-facing team who you would like to interview and to make it easy for\nthem to schedule the interview. Give them a script to follow. It might be as simple\nas this: If the customer trigger occurs, then say: “I’d love for you to share your\nfeedback with our product team. Can we schedule 20 minutes for you to talk with\nthem?” If they say “Yes,” have your colleague schedule the interview.\n\nInterview Your Customer Advisory Board\n\nIf your customers are particularly hard to reach (e.g., doctors, CEOs), or if\nyou have a small market (e.g., Canadian business schools, movie studios), the\nrecruiting strategies we’ve covered will be challenging. Your customer’s time is\neither too valuable, or you’ll have concerns about reaching out to the same\ncustomers over and over again.\n\nWhile most product teams worry their customers are too busy to talk with\nthem, for most teams, this won’t be true.

In these\ninstances, setting up a customer-advisory board will help.\n\nMost companies use their customer-advisory boards to host focus groups. That\nmay be valuable, but it’s not a replacement for interviews. You can also use your\ncustomer-advisory board as interview participants. Invite your advisory-board\nmembers to participate in a monthly one-on-one interview.

You can pair this recruiting method with one or two of\nthe other methods to avoid this fate.\n\nInterview Together, Act Together\n\nProduct trios should interview together. Some teams prefer to let one role,\nusually the product manager or the designer, be the “voice of the customer.”\nHowever, our goal as a product trio is to collaborate in a way that leverages\neveryone’s expertise. If one person is the “voice of the customer,” that role will\ntrump every other role.\n\nImagine that a product manager and a designer disagree on how to proceed.\nThe designer has done all the interviewing.

Long discussion\nguides exist for a reason. They are easy to create, and they allow everyone to get\ntheir favorite questions answered.

They noticed that some of their customers\nstarted looking for alternative accommodations closer to home. Instead of booking\nhotels and apartments in foreign countries, their customers were starting to book\nIstrahas. Istraha means “resting place” in Arabic and generally refers to a large\nproperty with an outdoor area, barbecue, and a pool. Guijou’s team, in previous\ncustomer interviews, had already uncovered that these properties were often used\nas day rentals to host social gatherings near home.

With each interview, the structure of the\nopportunity space continued to evolve.\n\nWhen they felt they had a good understanding of the opportunity space, they\ntook a step back to assess where they were.

Our customers’ stories are rife with gaps between what\nthey expect and how the world works. Each gap represents an opportunity to serve\nyour customer. However, it’s easy to get overwhelmed and not know where to start.\nEven if you worked tirelessly in addressing opportunity after opportunity for the\nrest of your career, you would never fully satisfy your customers’ desires.

It’s hard to answer either of these\nquestions if we don’t first take an inventory of the opportunity space.\n\nA single customer story might elicit dozens of opportunities. If you interview\ncontinuously, your opportunity space will always be evolving---expanding as you\nlearn about new needs, contracting as you address known problems, and gaining\nclarity as you learn more about specific pain points. Mapping the opportunity\nspace is a critical activity. Finding the best path to your desired outcome is an illstructured problem (introduced in Chapter 2) and requires that we first structure or\nframe the problem space before we can dive into solving it. Mapping the\nopportunity space is how we give structure to the ill-structured problem of reaching\nour desired outcome.\n\nIt’s easy, however, to bounce from one opportunity to the next, reacting to\nevery need or pain point we hear about. Most product teams are devoted to\nserving their customers, and, when they hear about a need or a pain point, they\nwant to solve it. But our job is not to address every customer opportunity. Our job\nis to address customer opportunities that drive our desired outcome. This is how\nwe create value for our business while creating value for our customers. Limiting\nour work to only the opportunities that might drive our desired outcome is what\nensures that our products are viable over the long run and not just desirable in the\nmoment.\n\nOur goal should be to address the customer opportunities that will have the\nbiggest impact on our outcome first. To do this, we need to start by taking an\ninventory of the possibilities. In the first quote that opens this chapter, John Dewey,\nan American educational philosopher, encourages us to “carry on systematic and\nprotracted inquiry.” Rather than jumping to the first need that we might address,\nDewey argues, good thinking requires that we explore our options---that we carry\nout a systematic search for longer than we feel comfortable. We should compare\nand contrast the impact of addressing one opportunity against the impact of\naddressing another opportunity. We want to be deliberate and systematic in our\nsearch for the highest-impact opportunity.\n\nIn the second quote that opens this chapter, cognitive psychologist Barbara\nTversky reminds us that structure “gets done, undone, and redone.” As the\nopportunity space grows and evolves, we’ll have to give structure to it again and\nagain.

We’ll dive into both options in\nmore detail here.\n\nIn Chapter 4, you learned how to visualize what you already know about your\ncustomers’ experience.

In\nChapter 5, I encouraged you to draw the stories that you heard. You do this by\nidentifying the key moments in time that occurred during each story. If you take all\nof these drawings and start to label each key moment (or node), you’ll notice\npatterns across your unique stories. What nodes are showing up in story after\nstory? How can you stitch the most common nodes together to create an\nexperience map that represents the set of stories that you are collecting?

This is what\nproduct thought leader Melissa Perri calls “the build trap.”28\n\nThis obsession with producing outputs is strangling us. It’s why we spend\ncountless hours prioritizing features, grooming backlogs, and micro-managing\nreleases. The hard reality is that product strategy doesn’t happen in the solution\nspace.

A\nsolution-first mindset is good at producing output, but it rarely produces outcomes.\nInstead, our customers care about solving their needs, pain points, and desires.\nProduct strategy happens in the opportunity space. Strategy emerges from the\ndecisions we make about which outcomes to pursue, customers to serve, and\nopportunities to address. Sadly, the vast majority of product teams rush past these\ndecisions and jump straight to prioritizing features. We obsess about the\ncompetition instead of about our customers.

This is what Bezos calls a “Level 1 decision.” For these types of decisions,\nwe want to be cautious, data-driven, and deliberate in our decision-making.\n\nWith a two-way door decision, on the other hand, when we walk through the\ndoor, if we don’t like what we see, we get to turn around and undo our decision.\nThis is what Bezos calls a “Level 2 decision.” He suggests that, with a two-way\ndoor decision, we’ll learn more by acting---walking through the door and seeing\nwhat’s on the other side---than we would by trying to imagine what’s on the other\nside of the door.\n\nWhen we assess and prioritize the opportunity space, even though these are\nsome of the most strategic decisions we make as a product trio, we are still making\ntwo-way door decisions. When you choose a target opportunity, you are choosing\nhow to spend your next few days or weeks. You are not committing to addressing\nthat opportunity. You are simply committing to exploring it further with your\ndiscovery work. If, as you proceed to explore solutions, you learn that this wasn’t\nthe best decision (e.g., you learned something new, you found the solutions to be\ntougher than you imagined, you learned it wasn’t as important to customers as you\nthought), you’ll simply turn around and choose another target opportunity.\n\nIt’s important that we frame our discovery decisions as two-way door,\nreversible decisions. Lottie Bullens and colleagues, social psychologists at the\nUniversity of Amsterdam, found in a series of studies that, when people viewed a\ndecision as reversible, they continued to critically evaluate their decision after\nmaking it. In fact, they were more likely to see the negative attributes of their\nchoice and the positive attributes of the alternatives after making the decision if\nthey viewed it as a reversible decision. If they framed it as an irreversible decision,\nthe opposite happened. People noticed only the positive attributes of their own\nchoice and the negative attributes of the alternatives.34 If we want to stay open to\nbeing wrong and avoid confirmation bias, it’s critical that we think of our\nprioritization decisions as reversible decisions.\n\nThe beauty of a continuous discovery process is that we can always coursecorrect as we learn.

We hear about a customer\nproblem or need, and our brain immediately jumps to a solution. It’s human\nnature. We are good at closing the loop---we hear about a problem, and our brain\nwants to solve it. However, creativity research tells us that our first idea is rarely\nour best idea. Researchers measure creativity using three primary criteria: fluency\n(the number of ideas we generate), flexibility (how diverse the ideas are), and\noriginality (how novel an idea is).35\n\nSimilar research shows that fluency is correlated with both flexibility and\noriginality.36 In other words, as we generate more ideas, the diversity and novelty\nof those ideas increases. Additionally, the most original ideas tend to be generated\ntoward the end of the ideation session.37 They weren’t the first ideas we came up\nwith.

{"segment_id": "00112", "page_num": 112, "segment": "challenges with brainstorming.\n\nThe Problem With Brainstorming\n\nBrainstorming was introduced and popularized by Alex Osborn, an executive\nat a respected advertising firm, in his 1953 book Applied Imagination. He\nbelieved brainstorming was the lynchpin underlying creativity and wanted to share\nhis company’s process with the world. To help put this book into context, it’s\nsimilar to what we see today with Ed Catmull’s book Creativity, Inc. about Pixar’s\ncreative process or Tom Kelley’s The Art of Innovation about how the leading\ndesign firm IDEO works. Like Pixar and IDEO today, people admired Osborn’s\ncreative success, and brainstorming spread quickly.\n\nOsborn outlined four rules for brainstorming. One, focus on quantity. In other\nwords, generate as many ideas as you can. Two, defer judgment, and separate idea\ngeneration from idea evaluation. Three, welcome unusual ideas. And four,\ncombine and improve ideas. He suggested that groups come together real-time,\nface-to-face (remember he predated the digital, asynchronous communication tools\nwe have today), to generate ideas together, using these four rules. For those of you\nwho have participated in brainstorming sessions, these rules aren’t new. They are\nstill in common use today.\n\nAs brainstorming rose in popularity, academic researchers started to question\nif it worked. Was brainstorming in groups the most effective way to generate ideas?\nFor decades researchers ran studies in which they compared the creative output of\nbrainstorming groups against the creative output of the same number of individuals\ngenerating ideas alone. Study after study found that the individuals generating\nideas alone outperformed the brainstorming groups. Individuals generated more\nideas, more diverse ideas, and more original ideas.38\n\nAs researchers dug into why individuals outperformed groups, they identified\nfour mitigating factors. First, research has found that people tend to work harder\nwhen working individually than when working in groups. This is called social\nloafing. When we are on our own, we have no choice but to put in the work,\nwhereas when we are in a group, we can rely on the efforts of others.\n\nSecond, brainstorming groups exhibited many of the common challenges\nassociated with group conformity. The early ideas set the tone for later ideas.

{"segment_id": "00113", "page_num": 113, "segment": "were often too conservative or similar to each other. Members censored their ideas\ndue to concerns about how others would judge their ideas.\n\nThird, brainstorming groups ran into challenges with production blocking---\nthat’s a fancy term for a simple idea. Have you ever been about to say something\nwhen someone else jumped in, prompting you to forget what you were going to\nsay? That’s production blocking. In group brainstorming sessions, people lose\nideas amid the chaos of everyone sharing ideas in rapid succession.\n\nAnd finally, the fourth factor is a common group trait known as downward\nnorm setting---the performance of the group tends to be limited to the lowestperforming member. Rather than the strongest member raising everyone else up,\nthe opposite happens. The weakest member brings everyone else down. These\nfactors combined to inhibit the performance of the brainstorming groups as\ncompared to the individuals who generated ideas alone.39\n\nThis raises the question: Why are brainstorming advocates so adamant that\nbrainstorming works? It turns out researchers have an answer to this question as\nwell. Bernard Nijstad and colleagues at the University of Groningen in the\nNetherlands found that brainstorming groups are subject to what they call “the\nillusion of group productivity.”40 This is a phenomenon in which groups\noverestimate their performance. They also report high levels of satisfaction with\ntheir work despite their lesser performance.\n\nNijstad and colleagues attribute this overestimation to a reduction in cognitive\nfailures. They define a “cognitive failure” as occurring when a participant can’t\ngenerate any ideas. When you are brainstorming alone, you generate more\ncognitive failures than when you are brainstorming in a group. Ideas from the\ngroup help other group members get unstuck.\n\nBut even with this group advantage, individuals generating ideas alone still\ngenerated more ideas, more diverse ideas, and more original ideas than\nbrainstorming groups. The individuals simply had to work harder to get there.\nHowever, since the brainstorming groups spent less time stuck, their perception\nwas that their performance was higher. This illusion of group productivity may\nexplain why so many brainstorming advocates consider it a panacea.\n\nSo, if we stick to what the research tells us, individuals generating ideas on\ntheir own do outperform brainstorming groups. Even if we think brainstorming is\neffective, we are probably falling prey to the illusion of group productivity.

Now,\nif you are wondering if there is a way to get the benefit of reducing cognitive\nfailures that we see in groups with the creative output of individuals brainstorming\non their own, it turns out there is.\n\nRuna Korde and Paul Paulus, researchers at the University of TexasArlington, ran a series of studies that showed alternating between individual\nideation and group sharing of ideas can improve the quality of ideas generated in\nsubsequent individual ideation sessions.41 Exposure to other people’s ideas did\ninspire new ideas.\n\nThe key difference here is that individuals still generated ideas on their own.\nParticipants started by ideating on their own. Then they shared their ideas with\nthe group. Then they went back to ideating on their own. They never ideated as a\ngroup, but they received the benefit of hearing each other’s ideas.

Generating ideas is hard work and takes effort. The first thing to recognize\nwhen you get stuck is that it happens to everyone. You aren’t bad at generating\nideas. You are creative.\n\nMany of us have self-limiting beliefs around creativity. We believe because we\ncan’t draw, paint, or play a musical instrument, we must not be creative. I’m here\nto tell you, you are. Creativity is a universal human trait. And as a product-team\nmember, there is no one better than you to generate creative solutions to your\ncustomers’ problems. If it’s been a while since you’ve generated ideas, it might be\nslow to start. That’s normal. Push through the discomfort and keep thinking. The\nfollowing tips will help.\n\nFirst, don’t try to spend an hour generating ideas. Take frequent breaks.\nSpread it out throughout your day. Try to generate ideas in the few minutes you\nhave between meetings. After lunch, go for a walk, and daydream about what you\nmight build. A change of scenery can often inspire new ideas. Try generating\nideas at different times of the day.

Find what works best for you.\nIn addition to ideating at different times and in different places, take advantage\nof incubation.42 Incubation occurs when your brain continues to consider a\nproblem even after you’ve stopped consciously thinking about it. You’ve probably\nexperienced this often in your life. After working on what seems like an unsolvable\nchallenge all day, you finally go home and take a break. After a good night’s sleep,\nyou come to work, returning to the problem. Instantly, you identify a solution. In\nfact, it’s hard to imagine why it seemed like such a hard problem yesterday. That’s\nincubation. And it works. Incubation can be particularly helpful after hearing\nother people’s ideas. You may not think of new ideas right away, but odds are,\nyour brain is still working on it in the background. So, if you get stuck, sleep on it.\nTomorrow will likely bring fresh ideas.\n\nAnother common way of getting unstuck is to look to analogous products for\ninspiration. For many product teams, this means competitive research. You should\ndraw inspiration from your competitors, but look broader than that. Many\ninnovative ideas come from unrelated domains. For example, Velcro was invented\nafter the inventor found a cocklebur in his sock. He was intrigued by how the\nlatching mechanism worked, and it inspired the design of Velcro.\n\nWhen you get stuck, start with your competition. But then look wider. Ask\nyourself: What other industries have solved similar problems? They don’t need to\nbe similar or even be in an adjacent industry. You are looking for similarities in the\ntarget opportunity. For example, if you work for a job board and you are helping\nrecruiters evaluate job candidates, you can look at other job boards, but you can\nalso look at how online shopping sites help shoppers evaluate products, you can\nlook at how travel aggregators help travelers choose hotels, and you can look at\nhow insurance companies present different policies. These industries are unrelated\nto each other, but they are each solving analogous problems.\n\nAdditionally, when you are stuck, you can start to consider what your extreme\nusers might need. What would a power user want? What does the first-time user\nneed? What about people with different disabilities? How about people who live\nin remote locations or bustling cities? Young people? Senior citizens?

So, when ideating, pretend\nyou have a magic wand---anything is possible.\n\nPutting It All Into Practice\n\nEnough theory. Let’s put some of these ideas into practice.\n1. Review your target opportunity. Make sure that everyone on your\nteam knows what it means and is familiar with the necessary context.

You aren’t limited to just the other players in\nyour space.\n\n3. Share ideas across your team. You can do this in a face-to-face, realtime meeting, or you can do it asynchronously in a digital chat channel (e.g., Slack\nor Microsoft Teams).

Remember, the benefit of sharing your ideas is\nthat hearing other people’s ideas will inspire even more ideas. So, don’t skip\nrepeating step 2 to ensure that you reap the rewards. Repeat until you’ve\ngenerated between 15 and 20 ideas for your target opportunity. Remember,\nresearch shows that your first ideas are rarely your best ideas.

First, start by asking for each, “Does this idea solve\nthe target opportunity?” It’s okay if it’s only a partial solution, but you’ll be\nsurprised to find several ideas that don’t solve your target opportunity at all. Don’t\nworry---this is a natural side effect of idea generation. But now is the time to weed\nthem out.\n\nNext, you’ll “dot-vote”43 as a team to whittle your set down from lots of ideas\nto three ideas. Dot voting is a simple method that facilitates group evaluation.\nResearch shows that while we are better at generating ideas individually, we are\nbetter at evaluating ideas as a group.44 To dot-vote, allot three votes per member.\nAs you vote, the only criteria you should be considering is how well the idea\naddresses the target opportunity. You aren’t voting for the coolest, shiniest ideas.\nNor are you ruling out the hardest or even impossible ideas. We’ll deal with that\ndown the road. Each person can assign their votes however they please. They can\nplace all three votes on one idea or vote for three ideas individually. Once everyone\nhas placed their votes, you’ll select the top three ideas that garnered the most votes.\nIt may take a few rounds of dot-voting to get to your top three. For example, if\nafter round one of voting, several ideas have one or two votes, but no ideas have\nthree or more votes, take some time to discuss your votes. Don’t let this turn into a\nlong debate or argument. Instead, let each person pitch the ideas they voted for.\nDuring your pitch, be sure to highlight why each idea best addresses the target\nopportunity. Then vote again.\n\nComing out of any voting round, if there’s a clear winner, set it aside as one of\nyour three to move forward with. Continue dot-voting until you have set aside\nthree ideas. It’s important after you are done dot-voting to take a quick poll and\nmake sure everyone on the team is excited about the set you are moving forward\nwith. This doesn’t mean you have to have consensus on all three options. But\neveryone on the team should be excited about at least one idea, and each idea\nshould have a strong advocate in the group.

You’ll learn how to answer that question with the next\ncouple of habits.\n\nAvoid These Common Anti-Patterns\n\nAs you generate ideas, be sure to avoid these common anti-patterns:\nNot including diverse perspectives. Most of the exercises in this book\nare designed for product trios to do together. However, ideation is best done with\nthe entire team. You want to make sure everyone has a chance to contribute their\nideas. You also might consider inviting key stakeholders who bring a different\nperspective. The more diversity in the group, the more diverse ideas you’ll\ngenerate. However, make sure that you set the context for ideation by sharing your\ntarget opportunity and the customer context in which that opportunity occurs.\n\nGenerating too many variations of the same idea. When we get\nstuck generating ideas, we tend to riff on variations of the same idea. If we try to\nlist as many types of animals as possible, once we identify lions and tigers, we\nmight add pumas, cheetahs, and snow leopards. This can be a good tactic for\nincreasing the number of ideas that you generate. However, when selecting three to\nbe in your consideration set, you want as much diversity as possible. So, this can’t\nbe the only way that you generate ideas. Instead, deliberately work to identify\ncategorically different ideas. If you get stuck, look for inspiration from analogous\nproducts. Analogous products don’t need to be from your industry. In fact, the\nfurther away they are from your industry, the more likely you’ll uncover diverse\nideas. So, ask, “Who else has to solve a problem like this?” and then investigate\nhow they solve it.\n\nLimiting ideation to one session. Hosting a brainstorming meeting is a\ncommon business norm.

The city council and the real estate developer made a\nnumber of assumptions about what displaced families wanted for housing, and\nneither thought to test those assumptions. The developer built a building consisting\nprimarily of one- and two-bedroom units. Both the city council and the developer\nthought this was how they could maximize impact and help the most families.\nUnfortunately, most of the displaced families were families of four or more. Oneor two-bedroom condos wouldn’t work for them. The city spent millions of dollars\nbuilding the wrong product for the outcome they wanted.\n\nSadly, the city of Portland is not the only organization to make this mistake.\nEvery product team has, at one time or another, found themselves facing the hard\nreality that they spent time, energy, and money building the wrong product.

In the Portland affordable-housing story (and in many others like it), we\nare seeing an interplay of two cognitive biases---confirmation bias and the\nescalation of commitment. Confirmation bias45 means we are more likely to seek\nout confirming evidence than we are to seek out disconfirming evidence. We pay\nattention to and remember the data that supports our perspective and often ignore\nor forget the data that undermines our perspective. Both the city and the developer\nwere excited by the positive feedback they got on their project but overlooked the\nnegative feedback. The escalation of commitment46 is a bias in which the more we\ninvest in an idea, the more committed we become to that idea. The more the city\nexplored this idea (and this idea alone), the more committed to the idea they\nbecame---despite its flaws.", "source_file": "Continuous_Discovery_Habits_-_Teresa_Torres.pdf", "extraction_method": "pdfminer", "ocr_used": false, "has_table": false, "chapter_num": null, "chapter_title": null, "section_num": null, "section_title": null}

As a result, we are often overconfident about the success of our ideas.\n\nChip and Dan Heath, authors of Decisive (introduced in Chapter 2), advise\nthat, if we want to avoid overconfidence and make better decisions, we need to be\nprepared to be wrong. You’ve already learned some techniques to help you adopt a\n“prepare to be wrong” mindset. In Chapter 7, you learned to compare and\ncontrast opportunities, so that you aren’t overcommitting to one. In Chapter 8, you\nwhittled your ideas down to three, again so that you don’t overcommit to one. In\nthis and the next chapter, we’ll explore how working with a set of ideas (that all\nhave the potential to solve the same target opportunity) will help us compare and\ncontrast the ideas against each other, helping us to avoid confirmation bias and the\nescalation of commitment.\n\nHowever, the way most teams test ideas isn’t feasible when working with a set\nof ideas.

As product trios, we are primarily\n\nconcerned with assumptions in the following categories:47\n\nDesirability assumptions: Does anyone want it? Will our customers get\nvalue from it? As we create solutions, we assume that our customers will want to\nuse our solution, that they will be willing to do the things that we need them to do,\nand that they’ll trust us to provide those solutions. All of these types of\nassumptions fall into the desirability category.\n\nViability assumptions: Should we build it? There are many ideas that\nwill work for our customers but won’t work for our business. If we want to continue\nto serve customers over time, we need to make sure that our solutions are viable---\nthat they create a return for our business. This typically means that the idea will\ngenerate more revenue than it will cost to build, service, and maintain. However,\nsome ideas are designed to be loss leaders and instead contribute to another\nbusiness goal besides revenue. But somewhere down the line, the idea must create\nenough value for the business to be worth the effort to create and maintain.\n\nFeasibility assumptions: Can we build it? We primarily think about\nfeasibility as technical feasibility. Is it technically possible? Feasibility assumptions,\nhowever, can also include, “What’s feasible for our business?” For example, will\nour legal or security team allow for it? Will our culture support it? Does it comply\nwith regulations?48\n\nUsability assumptions: Is it usable? Can customers find what they need?\nWill they understand how to use it or what they need to do? Are they able to do\nwhat we need them to do? Is it accessible?\n\nEthical assumptions: Is there any potential harm in building this idea?\nThis is an area that is grossly underdeveloped for many product trios. As an\nindustry, we need to do a better job of asking questions like: What data are we\ncollecting? How are we storing it? How are we using it? If our customers had full\ntransparency to those answers, would they be okay with it?\n\nBut this category isn’t limited to data usage.

After ideating, our ideas tend to be vague concepts. You can fit only\nso many words on a sticky note (virtual or physical). Even if you’ve taken the time\nto describe your ideas, odds are each person in your trio is interpreting the idea\ndifferently. This means that each person is making their own assumptions about\nhow the idea will work. It’s hard to test your underlying assumptions when you\ndon’t yet agree on what those assumptions are.\n\nOne of the best ways to align as a team around what your ideas mean is to\nstory map them. Story mapping is a popular technique in which teams map out\neach step end-users have to take to get value from a product or service.49 Story\nmapping forces you to get specific about how an idea will work and what you\nexpect your end-users will do.

Gary\nKlein, a cognitive psychologist and author of several books on decision-making,\nflipped the idea of a post-mortem on its head. Post-mortems are after-project\nreviews where participants assess what went wrong and what could have gone\nbetter. Sprint retrospectives are a type of post-mortem.

A pre-mortem encourages you to ask, “Imagine it’s six months in the\nfuture; your product or initiative launched, and it was a complete failure. What\nwent wrong?” As you generate reasons for why your product or service might fail,\nyou are exposing assumptions that your idea depends upon that may not be true.\n\nThe success of pre-mortems, however, hinges on one key factor---phrasing the\nquestion as if the outcome is certain. In our case, that means we have to consider\nthat the product or service did fail, not that it might fail. Deborah Mitchell,\nEdward Russo, and Nancy Pennington, collaborating psychologists at the\nUniversity of Pennsylvania, Cornell University, and the University of Colorado,\nfound the technique was effective at generating better explanations only when\nprospective hindsight was paired with a certain outcome.50\n\nWalk the Lines of Your Opportunity Solution Tree\n\nAnother way to generate assumptions, particularly viability assumptions, is to\nuse your opportunity solution tree to work backwards from your solution back to\nyour outcome.

In the next chapter, we’ll learn how to quickly test your “leap\nof faith” assumptions for each of your ideas so that you are able to compare and\ncontrast the ideas against each other.\n\nAvoid These Common Anti-Patterns\n\nAs you work to identify the hidden assumptions behind your ideas, be sure to\n\navoid these common anti-patterns:\n\nNot generating enough assumptions. Generating assumptions, like\nideating, is intended to be a divergent exercise. The goal is to identify as many\n“gotchas” as you can to increase the chance that you generate the riskiest ones.\nHowever, many teams dramatically underestimate how many assumptions underlie", "source_file": "Continuous_Discovery_Habits_-_Teresa_Torres.pdf", "extraction_method": "pdfminer", "ocr_used": false, "has_table": false, "chapter_num": null, "chapter_title": null, "section_num": null, "section_title": null}

If that sounds overwhelming, remember, you won’t need to test\nall of these assumptions. Most of them will be harmless. You’ll use the assumptionmapping exercise to quickly find the riskiest ones. However, if you don’t generate\nthe riskiest assumptions, the mapping exercise won’t help you sort something that\nyou haven’t uncovered. Use the five assumption categories and the exercises in this\nchapter to help you generate as many assumptions as you can.\n\nPhrasing your assumptions such that you need them to be false.\nGenerating assumptions can be a bit of a devil’s-advocate exercise. You are looking\nfor what might go wrong with your ideas. As a result, you might be tempted to\nphrase your assumptions negatively. For example, if you need your users to log in\nto your service, you might phrase your assumption as, “Customers won’t remember\ntheir password.” However, this is backwards. You need customers to remember\ntheir password for your idea to work. When you are generating assumptions,\nalways phrase your assumptions such that you need them to be true: “Customers\nwill remember their passwords.” For many assumptions, you’ll find that this\npositive framing will make them easier to test.\n\nNot being specific enough. I see many teams generate assumptions like\nthis: “Customers will have time,” “Customers will know what to do,” and “Our\nengineers can build something like this.” These assumptions are not specific\nenough to test. What will customers have time for? What do you need them to\nknow how to do? What do engineers need to build? Be specific. These\nassumptions are much better: “Customers will take the time to browse all the\noptions on our getting-started page,” “Customers will know how to select the right\noption based on their situation,” and “Our engineers can identify the right subset\nof options to show the customer based on the customer’s profile data.”\n\nFavoring one category at the cost of other categories. Most teams\nhave a bias toward one or two categories at the cost of the other categories. Some\nteams conflate desirability and usability and forget that just because a product is\nusable doesn’t mean it’s desirable. For products with challenging feasibility issues,\nit can be hard to remember to first test and see if customers even want the solution.\nMost teams forget about ethical assumptions altogether.

Just like with interviewing (see Chapter 5), to collect\nreliable data, we want to focus on collecting data about what people actually do in\na particular context, not just what they think or say they do in general.\n\nA strong assumption test simulates an experience, giving your participant the\nopportunity to behave either in accordance with your assumption or not. This\nbehavior is what allows us to evaluate our assumption.\n\nTo construct a good assumption test, you’ll want to think carefully about the\nright moment to simulate. You don’t want to simulate any more than you need to.\nThis is what allows you to iterate quickly through several assumption tests.\n\nLet’s return to our streaming-entertainment example, where we are trying to\naddress the target opportunity “I want to watch sports” and we’ve brainstormed a\nset of solutions---adding local channels, licensing events directly from sports\nleagues, and bundling our service with a sports provider.\n\nIf we are testing the assumption, “Our subscribers want to watch sports,” we\nmight simulate the moment when someone is browsing their streaming options,\ntrying to decide what to watch. We could do this by mocking up the “home\nscreen” that users see when they turn on the streaming-entertainment service.

Instead, we might present them with three\nsubscription services (including ours), tell them that the game is available on all\nthree services, and ask them to choose a service to stream the game.\n\nNow, neither of these simulations is perfect.

However, only the first\nand second ideas depend on the assumption “Our subscribers want to watch\nsports on our platform.” It’s common for ideas to share assumptions. It’s one of the\nreasons why assumption testing is faster than idea testing. Assumption tests don’t\nmerely give us a go/no-go decision for an individual idea; they help us evaluate sets\nof ideas. We’ll also see later how shared assumptions will help us generate even\nbetter ideas after a round or two of testing.\n\nOnce we’ve identified the moment in time that we want to simulate, we now\nneed to define how we’ll evaluate the behavior we observe. Our goal when\nconsidering our simulation evaluation is to define what success looks like. In other\nwords, if our assumption is true, what would we expect the participant to do?\n\nFor example, when observing people selecting what to watch, we might\nevaluate how many people choose to watch a sporting event vs. how many people\ndon’t.

First, you are\naligning as a team around what success looks like so that you all know how to\ninterpret the results. This will help to ensure that your assumption tests are\nactionable. And second, you are helping to guard against confirmation bias.\nRemember, confirmation bias makes us more likely to see the evidence that our\nidea will succeed than the evidence that it might not succeed. If we don’t define\nour success criteria upfront, when we try to interpret the results, our brains will\nactively look for evidence that supports the assumption, and we’ll likely miss the\nevidence that could refute it. To avoid this, we want to define what success looks\nlike upfront (before we see the results).\n\nSo how do we choose the numbers? This is a subjective decision.

You’ll be pleasantly surprised by how much you\ncan learn from getting feedback from a handful of customers.\n\nImagine we test the assumption, “Our subscribers want to watch sports,” as\ndescribed above.

We need to start defining the next-level\nexperiment that will allow us to collect more data.\n\nPerhaps, as a next step, we decide to add a section to our real “home screen”\npromoting an upcoming sporting event.

That’s\nwhen we learn that something we thought was true might not be. Small tests give\nus a chance to fail sooner. Failing faster is what allows us to quickly move on to the\nnext assumption, idea, or opportunity. Karl Popper, a renowned 20th-century\nphilosopher of science, in the opening quote argues, “Good tests kill flawed\ntheories,” preventing us from investing where there is little reward, and “we remain\nalive to guess again,” giving us another chance to get it right.\n\nAs we test assumptions, we want to start small and iterate our way to bigger,\nmore reliable, more sound tests, only after each previous round provides an\nindicator that continuing to invest is worth our effort.

When working with small numbers, we will\nencounter false positives and false negatives. Let’s explore the impact of these\nerrors on our work.\n\nIn your first round of experimenting, it is possible that you’ll select 10\nparticipants who all hate sports. We can mitigate the risk of this by choosing a\nvariety of folks. In other words, we don’t want to choose 10 participants from\nHonolulu, Hawaii (where no major sports teams reside), and expect to get reliable\nresults. Instead, we want to select for variation in geographic location,\ndemographics, TV-watching behavior, etc., as best we can. However, even if we\nselect for variation, it is still possible that none of our participants like sports when\nour larger population does. That’s because we aren’t doing the work to select a\nrepresentative sample, and we aren’t testing with large-enough numbers.\n\nWhen this happens, when our experiment fails, even though our larger\npopulation exhibits the behavior that we want to see, we call this a “false", "source_file": "Continuous_Discovery_Habits_-_Teresa_Torres.pdf", "extraction_method": "pdfminer", "ocr_used": false, "has_table": false, "chapter_num": null, "chapter_title": null, "section_num": null, "section_title": null}

In this particular example, where our\nassumption is testing our target opportunity “Our subscribers want to watch\nsports,” we might consider abandoning the opportunity. However, we aren’t likely\nto make this decision based on one failed test. Instead, if we are running tests\nacross our set of ideas, we will have additional data points to help us evaluate the\ntarget opportunity.\n\nFor example, if we test assumptions across three different ideas, all exploring if\nour subscribers are interested in sports, and all of them fail, then the chance that\nall of them are false negatives goes down. More likely, we’ll get conflicting results.\nWe’ll see one assumption fail and another one pass. We’ll need to dig in to learn\nwhy. In the worst-case scenario, one of our results will be a false negative, and we’ll\nhave to run additional experiments to evaluate our assumption. However, if our\ntests are small, this costs us only a day or two. This isn’t a very costly false\nnegative.\n\nMost of our assumptions, however, aren’t testing the opportunity. They are\ntesting some aspect of a particular solution. When these assumptions fail, we\ntypically design around them. We evolve our ideas so that they no longer depend\non the faulty assumption. For example, if we are testing the assumption “Our\nsubscribers know where to find sports on our platform,” and it turns out to be\nproblematic, we can always redesign the interface to make sports easier to find. If\nour failure was a false negative, it’s possible we might redesign our interface when\nwe don’t need to. But if further testing shows that our iteration works, the cost of\nthis false negative is only the time it took to do the redesign. Again, this false\nnegative isn’t that costly, as long as we keep our iterations and our future testing\nsmall.\n\nAdditionally, when we run fast iterations, we are in a better position to make\ndecisions using multiple data points from several tests rather than make decisions\nbased on a single data point. We can test if our subscribers want to watch sports\nthrough a number of testing methods. We can ask them about their past viewing\nbehavior and see if they have watched sports in the past. We can show them a\nmockup and ask them what they would like to watch right now. We can simulate\nthe moment before the big game and see if they choose our service.

There are hundreds, if not thousands, of ideas that could address our target\nopportunity or opportunities that could drive our desired outcome. When we throw\none away needlessly, it’s not that costly, as long as we find an idea that does work\nor an opportunity that does have an impact. Remember, there isn’t one right idea\nor one right opportunity. We can afford false negatives because ideas and\nopportunities are abundant.\n\nNow let’s turn to false positives. A false positive is when our test gives us data\nsuggesting that our assumption is true, when it isn’t. This sounds far riskier than a\nfalse negative, but, in practice, it’s not. Suppose we run our small test, and we\nlearn that everyone wants to watch sports, so we call our test a success, and we\nmove forward. Remember, we aren’t making a go/no-go decision based on one\nassumption test. We are either moving on to test another assumption related to the\nsame idea, or we are running a bigger, more reliable test on the same assumption.\nIf our idea really is faulty, odds are that our next round of assumption testing will\ncatch it. False positives usually get surfaced in successive rounds of testing. The\ncost of a false positive in a small test is usually the time and effort required to run\nthe next-bigger test. That’s not trivial, but we still avoid the far-bigger cost of\nbuilding the wrong solutions.\n\nI want to be clear: There is a cost to false negatives and false positives. And\nwe should be aware that these costs exist. But the cost is not so great that we\nshould be starting with large-scale, quantitative experiments every time.

In social science, we\nthink a landmark research study means one thing, until years of more research\nshow there was a confounding variable that wasn’t accounted for. Social-science\ntruths often evolve. Research is messy, and creating new knowledge is hard.\n\nProduct teams, fortunately, are not creating new knowledge.

This is a\nfantastic feedback loop. We quickly get to measure if our product had the intended\nimpact. We work on much faster cycles than science.

However, we still need to learn\nhow to quickly execute our assumption tests.\n\nThere are two tools that should be in every product team’s toolbox---\nunmoderated user testing and one-question surveys. Unmoderated user-testing\nservices allow you to post a stimulus (e.g., a prototype) and define tasks to\ncomplete and questions to answer. Participants then complete the tasks and answer\nthe questions on their own time. You get a video of their work. These types of tools\nare game changers. Instead of having to recruit 10 participants and run the\nsessions yourself, you can post your task, go home for the night, and come back the\nnext day to a set of videos ready for you to watch.\n\nIf we look at the two simulations we designed above, both could be conducted\nwith unmoderated testing tools. Once results come in, we would simply have to\nwatch the videos and record how many chose sports in the first assumption test and\nhow many chose our subscription service in the second assumption test. What used\nto take weeks to recruit, schedule, and conduct a prototype test can now be done in\na day or two.\n\nTo make unmoderated testing work well, you need to be thoughtful about who\nyou recruit. With both of our tests, we need to recruit our own subscribers. So,\nwe’ll need to screen for this. We also want to pay particular attention to variation\n(as discussed above). This is also something we can screen for. Some\nunmoderated testing tools also allow you to upload your own list of participants.\nThis is particularly helpful when testing with niche audiences.\n\nMany assumptions can be tested with quick answers to a single question. This\nis where one-question survey tools can be tremendously helpful. If we wanted to\ntest the “Our subscribers want to watch sports” assumption in more than one way,\nwe could launch a one-question survey asking them, “When was the last time you\nwatched a sporting event?” We could use their answers to triangulate with our\nprototype simulation.\n\nSometimes we simply need to learn about our customers’ preferences. For\nexample, if we were testing the assumption “Our platform has the sports our\nsubscribers want to watch,” we could test this with a one-question survey.

So instead of\ndefining their evaluation criteria as 7 out of 10, they tend to favor the percentage.\nThese sound equivalent, but they aren’t. First, when testing with small numbers,\nwe can’t conclude that 7 out of 10 will continue to mean 70% as our participant\nsize grows.

I had\nexperience in the recruiting industry, but little experience with this particular\ncustomer segment, so I kicked off my continuous-interviewing habit during the first\nweek on the job.\n\nRight away, I learned something surprising. I asked college seniors to tell me\nabout their experience looking for a job. Most expressed the same sentiment over\nand over again. The vast majority of job boards (including ours) asked students\ntwo questions: 1) What type of job do you want? 2) In what location?\nUnfortunately, most of the students that I talked to didn’t know how to answer\neither of these questions. They had no idea what types of jobs they were qualified\nfor, and they were open to living in many places. The average 22-year-old doesn’t\nhave enough work experience to even be aware of what types of jobs exist, and they\nhave the location flexibility to go where the best opportunities are. Some had a\npreference to return home or to stay near their college town, but about half were\nwilling to go anywhere. It didn’t take long for me to realize this was a huge\nproblem. We had to stop asking college students questions they couldn’t answer.\n\nAs a product team, we realized that we had proprietary data that could help\nus solve this problem. We had years of behavioral data about which types of jobs\nstudents applied to, and, more importantly, we knew from working with employers\nwhat types of students they wanted for different types of jobs.

But before we invested in a machine-learning algorithm\n(we didn’t know anything about machine learning yet), we needed to learn if this\nidea was worth investing in. It was so different from what everyone else was doing,\nwe needed to make sure it would work.\n\nTo build a quick prototype, we realized that, as working professionals, we had\nmore experience with job types than most college seniors and that we could create\na crude approximation of our matching algorithm by creating saved searches for\neach of the areas of study in our system. Instead of having a sophisticated machinelearning algorithm behind the scenes, we simply crafted search queries ourselves.\nFor example, if a student indicated they were an English major, we might search\nfor marketing, content management, journalism, speech writing, and publicrelations jobs. It wouldn’t be perfect, but we thought it would be better than what\nstudents were entering themselves.\n\nWe also knew it would help us quickly evaluate how successful our new idea\nmight be. We had dozens of assumptions we wanted to test. Would college\nstudents trust our recommendations? Would they be open to exploring jobs they\nthemselves didn’t select? Would they be confused by our unique interface? After\nall, every other job board asked them to enter what type of job they wanted. Could\nwe collect enough feedback to continue to refine our algorithm? Would our metrics\nshow that this solution was better than what we currently had?\n\nWe knew we wanted to start small, as this idea was full of risk. So, we started\nby diverting a small percentage of our traffic to a new search page. Students\nentered their area of study, and we ran the relevant “saved search” behind the\nscenes.

Our new questions were much\neasier to answer, so more students were able to start their search.\n\nBut what happened after that? We found that students who entered job types\nand locations were more likely to view and apply for jobs, but not by much (only\nabout 10%). We suspected it was because these students already had an inkling of\nwhat they wanted to do and where they wanted to work. But for everyone else, that\ninterface simply didn’t work. In our new interface, we saw a small drop-off in the\nnumber of searchers who viewed and applied for jobs, but we saw many more\nstudents start their search, so our overall performance was much better in the new\ninterface. We knew right away it was safe to keep investing in this idea.\n\nBut where should we go from here? We didn’t have a production-quality\nproduct. Remember, we tested with a crude prototype that we cobbled together in\njust a few days. We still had many more assumptions to test. We didn’t feel like we\nwere done with discovery. But we also were seeing better results with our prototype\nthan we were with our production-quality product.\n\nWe debated about whether we should switch all of our traffic to the new\nprototype. We were seeing great results from our early assumptions tests, but we\nstill had one key question to answer: Did our new idea drive our desired outcome?\nOur desired outcome wasn’t to increase search starts, nor was it to increase job\nviews or job applications. It was to increase the number of students getting jobs\nthrough our platform. We thought if we could get more students starting their\nsearch, we would increase the number of students who found jobs on our platform.\nBut job views and applications aren’t always leading indicators of hires. A student\ncan view and apply to many jobs and never hear back from an employer. We\nneeded to make sure that students were as likely (and hopefully, more likely) to\nfind a job with our new interface as they were with our old interface.

When do we get to send\nour ideas to delivery?” The answer to the first question is simple. You are never\ndone with discovery. Remember, this book is about continuous discovery. There is\nalways more to learn and to discover. The second question is harder to answer. In\nthe AfterCollege story, we had already started the delivery work. Our prototype\nhad a working interface that real customers could use. We were collecting real\ndata. Our discovery required that we start delivery. Measuring the impact of that\ndelivery resulted in us needing to do more discovery.\n\nThis is why we say discovery feeds delivery and delivery feeds discovery. They\naren’t two distinct phases. You can’t have one without the other. In Chapter 10,\nyou learned to iteratively invest in experiments, to start small, and to grow your\ninvestment over time. Inevitably, as your experiments grow, you are going to need\nto test with a real audience, in a real context, with real data. Testing in your\nproduction environment is a natural progression for your discovery work. It’s also\nwhere your delivery work begins. If you instrument your delivery work, discovery\nwill not only feed delivery, but delivery will feed discovery.\n\nIn this chapter, you’ll learn how to instrument your product so that you can\nevaluate assumption tests using live prototypes. You’ll learn how to measure the\nimpact of your delivery work, using your desired outcome as your North Star. And\nyou’ll learn how to keep your discovery and delivery tightly coupled so that you\nnever have to wonder if you are ready for delivery.\n\nDon’t Measure Everything\n\nIt’s counterintuitive, but when instrumenting your product, don’t try to\nmeasure everything from the start. You’ll quickly get overwhelmed. You’ll spend\nweeks debating what events to track, how to name your events, and who is\nresponsible for what before you even get started. This is a waste of time.

This is an important distinction to pay\nattention to when instrumenting your product. Sometimes you’ll want to count\npeople. Other times you’ll want to count actions. A good way to suss this out is to\nask, “If one person did many actions, does that create as much value as many\npeople doing one action?” If you need many people to take action, you’ll want to\ncount people. If it doesn’t matter how many people take action, you’ll want to\ncount actions.\n\nIn this case, our assumptions were more about the perception of our new\ninterface. We were concerned that students might not trust our recommendations.\nSo, we wanted to measure how many people engaged with our job listings. We\nwanted to make sure that the new interface was working for more people than the\nold interface.\n\nHowever, when we started to measure the relevance of our saved searches, we\nstarted to count actions.

We measured the position of a job view in the search result (e.g., a\nstudent viewed the first vs. third job in the search results). We also measured the\nratio of job views to job applications (e.g., the number of jobs someone had to view\nbefore they applied for a job).\n\nCounting people helped us understand how many of our students were having\nsuccess on our platform.

For our assumption tests, we were\nmeasuring search starts, job views, and job applications, but these metrics were\nonly leading indicators of our desired outcome.\n\nOver time, we also wanted to move closer to measuring our outcome itself, so\nthat we could track progress week over week and quarter over quarter. When I\nstarted at AfterCollege, we didn’t have a way of measuring how often a student\ngot a job. We lost track of students after they applied for a job. The post-apply\nsteps like interviewing, receiving an offer, and accepting an offer all happened off\nof our platform. We needed to find a way to incentivize students to tell us when\nthey got a job or employers to tell us when they made a hire.\n\nSome people in the company argued that we should measure our success by\njob applications.

We knew that, if we were relentless, we\nwould find a way to track our desired outcome.\n\nHere’s the key lesson. Just because the hire wasn’t happening on our platform\ndidn’t mean it wasn’t valuable for us to measure it.

In the\nAfterCollege story, our product outcome was to improve search starts, and we\nsucceeded at doing that. But our business outcome was to increase the number of\nstudents who found jobs on our platform. We had to continue to instrument our\nproduct to evaluate if driving our product outcome had the intended impact on our\nbusiness outcome. This work took longer than expected. We didn’t want to wait to\nhave the final answer before pushing value to our customers, so we continued to\nexperiment in our production environment. Our discovery continued through to\ndelivery.\n\nThis isn’t uncommon. However, in the AfterCollege story, it was easy for us\nto experiment in production. We were able to get a working prototype live in only a\nfew days. Let’s return to our streaming-entertainment example to work through a\nmore complex case.

We can look at whether their overall viewing minutes\nwent up, or if they cut out content in other areas to make time for the sporting\nevent. Integrating all\nlocal-channel content might require new business\npartnerships, contracts to be signed, and APIs to be developed.

We started by defining a clear desired outcome, we interviewed to\ndiscover opportunities, we visually captured and synthesized what we were\nlearning with experience maps and opportunity solution trees, we prioritized a\ntarget opportunity, we brainstormed solutions, we\nidentified our hidden\nassumptions, we rapidly tested those assumptions, and we continued to measure\nimpact all the way through delivery. It’s easy to think that, if we simply follow the\nprocess, we’ll come out the other side with a product that customers love.\nUnfortunately, it’s not that simple. The reality is this process is a messy, winding\npath with lots of twists and turns. Most of the work in discovery is not following\nthe process---it’s managing the cycles.\n\nIn this chapter, I’ll highlight stories of real product teams who, throughout the\ncourse of their discovery work, learned something surprising along the way. The\nsurprise required that they stop charging forward and instead loop back to a\nprevious step.

Simply Business is one of the UK’s biggest\nbusiness-insurance providers, specializing in public-liability insurance for small-tomidsize enterprises and insuring more than 750,000 small businesses, landlords,\nand not-for-profit organizations. Many of Simply Business’s customers are\nfreelancers and small-business owners who often struggle with clients not paying\ninvoices on time, creating financial strain. Not only did the team hear about this\npain point in a number of their customer interviews, but they also had market\nresearch and government data that suggested that late payments were a top\nproblem for small businesses.\n\nWhen Mina’s team started assessing and prioritizing the opportunity space,\nchoosing this opportunity as their target opportunity was a no-brainer. They\ngenerated several solutions and identified a diverse set of three to test: 1) articles to\neducate small-businesses owners on how to prevent late payments, 2) the ability to\noffer discounts for early payments, and 3) a service that automated payment\ncollection.\n\nWithin a week, they were able to launch three assumption tests, one for each\nidea. To test if their customers were willing to read content about how to prevent\nlate payments, they integrated a couple of existing blog articles about late payments\nonto their customer-account page and measured how many customers clicked\nthrough to read them. For invoice discounting and automatic payment collection,\ntheir riskiest assumptions were around the complexity of each of these ideas.

They then asked each participant to explain if the offering would\nhave helped them collect on their most recent late payment. They were primarily\ninterested in evaluating if the participants fully understood the benefits of each\nsolution.\n\nUnfortunately, the first assumption test failed. A very small percentage of\ncustomers clicked through to read the articles about how to prevent late payments.\nThe team was concerned that the customer-account page might not be the right\nplace to integrate the content and started to brainstorm other places to share the\ncontent. But they stopped once they watched the videos from their other two tests.\nNot only did most participants struggle to understand the solutions, but most also\nexpressed that, while they had issues with late payments, they weren’t interested in\nthird-party help in solving the problem. They each expressed that they had strong\nrelationships with their clients, and they felt that removing themselves from the\ncollections process would harm the relationship.\n\nThis was a big surprise for Mina’s team. Even though they had heard late\npayments come up as a pain point in interview after interview and they had market\nresearch reinforcing what they had heard, the results of their assumption tests were\nclear.

So, when\nthey revisited their opportunity solution tree to choose a new target opportunity,\nthey weren’t starting from scratch.

She compares\nthe user experience to a dating site, where the goal is for a customer to “find the\nright one and make a commitment,” only in CarMax’s case, it’s with a vehicle\nrather than another human being.\n\nThrough the course of customer interviews, Victoria’s team identified the\ntarget opportunity: “I want to feel confident that this car is in good condition.”\nAdditionally, they saw new competitors start to highlight the cosmetic condition of\ntheir vehicles by visually indicating where a vehicle had dings, dents, or scratches,\nand Victoria’s team was hearing from consumers that they appreciated having this\ninformation. Many product teams would simply copy what their competitors were\ndoing, but for Victoria’s team, it wasn’t that simple. A key value proposition for\nCarMax vehicles is that they go through an inspection-and-reconditioning process\nthat fixes many of the cosmetic issues that their competitors were highlighting.\nOdds are, if a competitor is highlighting a ding on a vehicle, CarMax couldn’t\nhighlight that same ding on their vehicle, because they would have fixed it in their\nreconditioning process. Would consumers understand that CarMax wasn’t\nhighlighting dings, dents, and scratches because they had fixed them?\n\nVictoria’s team had several questions they needed to answer before they could\ntackle this opportunity. While consumers were saying they valued the cosmetic\ncondition of a vehicle, Victoria’s team didn’t want to take this for granted.

To test whether customers were accurately describing their own\npriorities, Victoria’s team set up a test in which they had wireframe versions of the\nsame car---one had minor cosmetic issues and was $1,000 cheaper, while the\nother had no cosmetic issues but cost $1,000 more. Through this testing, they\nlearned that people were willing to pay more for cars that were cosmetically\nreconditioned. This was a key learning, because it meant that CarMax’s\nreconditioning value proposition was important to customers.\n\nNext, they had to figure out how to communicate this value proposition to their\ncustomers. Victoria’s team had two primary strategies for how they might do this.\nThey could try to address the opportunity by highlighting the value of CarMax’s\ninspection-and-reconditioning program (a more generalized approach), or they\ncould address it by sharing vehicle-specific reconditioning information (e.g., “A\nding was removed”). Due to the volume of cars CarMax sells and the work that\nwould be required to test vehicle-specific concepts, Victoria’s team knew that the\nquickest path to drive customer value would be to leverage general reconditioning\nto solve this opportunity, and wanted to prioritize discovery in that space before\nexploring larger efforts around vehicle-specific solutions.\n\nVictoria’s team knew that customers primarily evaluated cosmetic condition by\nviewing photos of the car. So, they experimented with adding text overlays on top\nof the images that highlighted CarMax’s reconditioning work (e.g., “No major\ndings or dents”). The image gallery is one of the most engaged areas on the page,\nso the team established a high test threshold to ensure that they were truly solving\nthe customer opportunity and could justify the high-visibility placement of the\ncontent. However, after several experiments, they were still unable to meet the test\nthresholds. Their changes did help consumers build trust in CarMax’s inspectionand-reconditioning process, but they were still hearing from consumers that they\nwanted vehicle-specific information to truly build confidence in a specific car’s\ncondition. After a series of attempts, Victoria’s team concluded that they had done\nas much as they could at this moment in time to address their target opportunity.\nThey learned that, to really solve it, they would need to consider vehicle-specific\nsolutions.

Victoria’s team chose an opportunity that they thought they could\ntackle quickly by leveraging CarMax’s strong brand, however, they learned that\nconsumers really needed vehicle-specific solutions and, as a result, the team had to\ndefer this particular opportunity to later.

This led Carl’s team to identify “What can I afford?” as an\nopportunity that they might be able to address digitally.\n\nThey experimented to figure out how to address this opportunity with an\nonline calculator. The idea was that a potential customer could enter the relevant\ninformation and the calculator would provide the answer, similar to an online\nmortgage calculator. In this scenario, the calculator would be a self-serve option for\ncustomers.\n\nBut since they’d heard from customers that human interaction was important,\nCarl’s team was concerned that an online calculator might not be sufficient.

They dove\ninto NPS comments and interview feedback and identified several opportunities.\nTwo of these opportunities were already very familiar: “I don’t have enough\napplications” and “I don’t have the right applications.” But they were surprised to\nuncover a brand-new opportunity: “I can’t get in touch with my candidates.” As\nthey spoke with hiring managers, Amy and Jenn discovered that they could rarely\nconnect with candidates on the phone. Only about one in ten candidates answered\nthe phone when a hiring manager called, and hardly any of them returned the call\nafter receiving a voicemail message from a hiring manager.\n\nThrough their customer interviews, Amy and Jenn learned that this was an\nissue with every applicant from all hiring platforms---not just Snagajob. This\nmeant they had a “big, hairy problem that no one understood, which would be a\nmajor, multi-faceted win for us if we solved it.”\n\nBut the challenge with a “big, hairy problem,” as Amy and Jenn describe it, is\n\nthat it can be difficult to address.

Describing this\nexperience, they say, “It was exhausting, illuminating, and amazing.”\n\nThrough their in-depth research, Amy and Jenn discovered a number of\nsmaller sub-opportunities that helped them better understand why hiring managers\nwere struggling to get in touch with candidates.

First, they would text to ask if it was a good time to\ncall before calling a candidate. When that went well, they began exploring other\nways to communicate via text---most often attempting to ask follow-up questions\nand schedule interviews. They tried sending texts both as people and as bots, but\nquickly realized this was only a temporary solution, since most hiring managers\nwould not want to use their personal devices to text candidates.\n\nThey knew that, to solve this problem, it had to work for both the candidates\nand the hiring manager. So, they started looking for mobile-first, web-accessible\ntools that allowed managers to communicate via text and candidates to answer\nfrom a phone. They would send a text asking candidates if they’d be willing to\nanswer a few follow-up questions on their application. If they answered “Yes,” they\nwould send them a link to a SurveyMonkey form. This was easy to set up and fill\nout on a mobile device. This small tweak allowed them to connect with candidates\nin a way that simply wasn’t happening before.\n\nOnce they were able to successfully connect hiring managers with candidates,\nthey discovered the next problem: Finding a time to schedule interviews required a\nlot of back and forth.

More often\nthan not, this is exactly what our stakeholders are asking us to share. Even in\ncompanies that espouse a focus on outcomes, we still tend to spend most of our\ntime talking about outputs.\n\nThe challenge with this approach is that our stakeholders often have their own\nconclusions. It’s easy to have an opinion about outputs. We all have our own\npreferences about how a product or service should work. When we anchor the\nconversation in the solution space, we encourage our stakeholders to share their\nown preferences. However, these preferences aren’t always grounded in good\ndiscovery. After all, it’s our job to do discovery, not our stakeholders’.\n\nWhen you frame the conversation in the solution space, you are framing the\nconversation to be about your opinion about what to build versus your\nstakeholders’ opinion about what to build.

I had just graduated from college and was starting my first fulltime job as an application software developer at HighWire Press, a division of the\nStanford University Libraries and a pioneer in bringing STEM journals online. I\nwas hired as a designer and front-end engineer working on several online\ncommunities for academic researchers. Our goal was to bring researchers from\nacross disciplines (think biology, chemistry, medicine) who were working on the\nsame types of problems together in a collaborative online space. We were working\non innovative features like virtual folders to replace physical filing cabinets that\nstored decades of journal articles and message boards where researchers could\ndiscuss said journal articles. This was 1999, and the World Wide Web was the\nnew frontier.\n\nAs a college student, I was introduced to human-centered design and was\nexcited to put what I learned into practice on the job. I remember my first design\nassignment like it was yesterday. Our client, the American Association for the\nAdvancement of Science (AAAS) was our collaborating partner on our first\nonline community, and they had a long list of feature requests. My job was to\ndesign site navigation that encompassed all of those features. I spent a grand total\nof three days playing with different ideas and then walked into my first-ever client\nmeeting.\n\nI presented my designs, confident in my work (after all, my manager liked it),\nand waited for the accolades to roll in.

So much for that high-priced, human-centered\ndesign education.\n\nActually, what that education gave me was the ability to bounce back. I knew\nthat, while my boss (and the rest of the company) operated by throwing designs\nover the wall, it didn’t mean I had to. I got to choose how I did my own work, and\nI knew if I was going to be good at design, I needed to keep the client and the enduser close. I started right then and there on that call. I invited the woman who was\nunhappy with my design to partner with me on the next iteration.
