Though we use P&G as our main example, this doesn’t\nmean that our approach to strategy can only be effective in a global\nconsumer goods company. We’ve seen it powerfully used in all manner\nof industries and all sizes of organizations, including start-ups, not-forprofits, and government agencies. But it was at P&G that we were really\nable to use this approach across a wide range of businesses, geographies,\nand functions and over a decade (and to see where it worked and didn’t\nwork)---so that is the story we have chosen to tell. We will use P&G\nbrand, category, sector, function, and company examples to illustrate the\nstrategy concepts and tools throughout the book. Of course, not all\ncompanies look like P&G. But it is our hope that through examples from\nacross P&G’s diverse businesses, organizations, and levels, the lessons\nfor your organization will become clear.\n\nWhat Is Strategy?\n\nStrategy is a relatively young discipline. Until the middle of the last\ncentury, much of what people now think of as strategy was categorized\nsimply as management. So it is really no wonder that many organizations\nstruggle to define what a strategy is and how to create a useful one; there\nis no single, clear, and pervasive definition of strategy and even less\nconsensus on how to build one. When a strategy succeeds, it seems a\nlittle like magic, unknowable and unexplainable in advance but obvious\nin retrospect.\n\nIt isn’t. Really, strategy is about making specific choices to win in the\nmarketplace. According to Mike Porter, author of Competitive Strategy,\nperhaps the most widely respected book on strategy ever written, a firm\ncreates a sustainable competitive advantage over\nits rivals by\n“deliberately choosing a different set of activities to deliver unique\nvalue.”1 Strategy therefore requires making explicit choices---to do some\nthings and not others---and building a business around those choices.2 In\nshort, strategy is choice. More specifically, strategy is an integrated set\nof choices that uniquely positions the firm in its industry so as to create\nsustainable advantage and superior value relative to the competition.\n\nMaking choices is hard work, and it doesn’t always fit with all the\nother work to be done. In our view, far too few companies have a clear,", "source_file": "Playing_to_Win__How_Strategy_Really_Works_-_AG_Lafley.pdf", "extraction_method": "pdfminer", "ocr_used": false, "has_table": false, "chapter_num": null, "chapter_title": null, "section_num": null, "section_title": null}

Too often, CEOs in\nparticular will allow what is urgent to crowd out what is really important.\nWhen an organizational bias for action drives doing, often thinking falls\nby the wayside. Instead of working to develop a winning strategy, many\nleaders tend to approach strategy in one of the following ineffective\nways:\n\n1. They define strategy as a vision. Mission and vision statements are\nelements of strategy, but they aren’t enough. They offer no guide\nto productive action and no explicit road map to the desired future.\nThey don’t include choices about what businesses to be in and not\nto be in. There’s no focus on sustainable competitive advantage or\nthe building blocks of value creation.\n\n2. They define strategy as a plan. Plans and tactics are also elements\nof strategy, but they aren’t enough either. A detailed plan that\nspecifies what the firm will do (and when) does not imply that the\nthings it will do add up to sustainable competitive advantage.\n\n3. They deny that long-term (or even medium-term) strategy is\n\npossible. The world is changing so quickly, some leaders argue,\nthat it’s impossible to think about strategy in advance and that,\ninstead, a firm should respond to new threats and opportunities as\nthey emerge. Emergent strategy has become the battle cry of many\ntechnology firms and start-ups, which do indeed face a rapidly\nchanging marketplace. Unfortunately, such an approach places a\ncompany in a reactive mode, making it easy prey for morestrategic rivals. Not only is strategy possible in times of\ntumultuous change, but it can be a competitive advantage and a\nsource of significant value creation. Is Apple disinclined to think\nabout strategy? Is Google? Is Microsoft?\n\n4. They define strategy as the optimization of the status quo. Many\n\nleaders try to optimize what they are already doing in their current\nbusiness. This can create efficiency and drive some value. But it\nisn’t strategy. The optimization of current practices does not\naddress the very real possibility that the firm could be exhausting\nits assets and resources by optimizing the wrong activities, while\nmore-strategic competitors pass it by.

They define strategy as following best practices. Every industry\n\nhas tools and practices that become widespread and generic. Some\norganizations define strategy as benchmarking against competition\nand then doing the same set of activities but more effectively.\nSameness isn’t strategy. It is a recipe for mediocrity.\n\nThese ineffective approaches are driven by a misconception of what\nstrategy really is and a reluctance to make truly hard choices. It is natural\nto want to keep options open as long as possible, rather than closing off\npossibilities by making explicit choices. But it is only through making\nand acting on choices that you can win. Yes, clear, tough choices force\nyour hand and confine you to a path. But they also free you to focus on\nwhat matters.\n\nWhat matters is winning. Great organizations---whether companies,\nnot-for-profits, political organizations, agencies, what have you---choose\nto win rather than simply play. What is the difference between the Mayo\nClinic and the average research hospital in your neighborhood? Your\nlocal hospital is, most likely, focused on providing a service and on\ndoing good.

And it\ndoes.\n\nThe Playbook: Five Choices, One Framework, One\nProcess\n\nWinning should be at the heart of any strategy. In our terms, a strategy is\na coordinated and integrated set of five choices: a winning aspiration,\nwhere to play, how to win, core capabilities, and management systems.\nChapter 1 introduces these five essential choices as strategic questions.\nEach of chapters 2 through 6 dwells at some length on one of the\nquestions, explaining the nature of the choice to be made, providing a\nnumber of examples of that choice, and offering some advice for making\nthe choice in your own context.

Until the middle of the last\ncentury, much of what people now think of as strategy was categorized\nsimply as management. So it is really no wonder that many organizations\nstruggle to define what a strategy is and how to create a useful one; there\nis no single, clear, and pervasive definition of strategy and even less\nconsensus on how to build one. When a strategy succeeds, it seems a\nlittle like magic, unknowable and unexplainable in advance but obvious\nin retrospect.\n\nIt isn’t. Really, strategy is about making specific choices to win in the\nmarketplace. According to Mike Porter, author of Competitive Strategy,\nperhaps the most widely respected book on strategy ever written, a firm\ncreates a sustainable competitive advantage over\nits rivals by\n“deliberately choosing a different set of activities to deliver unique\nvalue.”1 Strategy therefore requires making explicit choices---to do some\nthings and not others---and building a business around those choices.2 In\nshort, strategy is choice. More specifically, strategy is an integrated set\nof choices that uniquely positions the firm in its industry so as to create\nsustainable advantage and superior value relative to the competition.\n\nMaking choices is hard work, and it doesn’t always fit with all the\nother work to be done.

These\nwomen would pay significant premiums for promising products, and this\nwas where the leading brands tended to focus. But, Drosos recalls, “We\nfound, as we looked at consumer needs in the market, that there was real\ngrowth potential with consumers who were thirty-five-plus, when they\nnoticed their first lines and wrinkles. Before that, a lot of women were\nstill using hand and body lotions on their face or really nothing at all.”4\nThe midthirties seemed to be a potential point of entry in women’s skin\ncare. At this age, consumers become more aware of, and committed to, a\nregimen---cleansing, toning, and moisturizing and using day creams,\nnight creams, weekly facials, and other treatments to keep the\nappearance of youthful, healthy skin. In their midthirties, women tend to\nbecome more highly committed to skin care and are more willing to pay\nfor quality and innovation. They seek out a preferred brand on a regular\nbasis and try new offerings from it. They become loyal devotees. These\nwere the consumers Olay needed, but to play in this segment, Olay\nwould have to up its game significantly.\n\nTraditionally in the beauty industry, department store brands have\ntaken the lead on innovation, developing new products and better\nproducts that, over time, trickle down to the mass market. Given P&G’s\ngreater scale, lower distribution costs, and considerable in-house R&D\ncapabilities, there was an opportunity to lead on innovation from the\nmiddle of the market. “We could flip this consumer paradigm that the\nbest technology trickles down,” Drosos says. “We could have the best\ntechnology come from Olay.” So, P&G scientists went to work on\nsourcing and developing better and more-effective compounds---skincare products that could dramatically outperform existing products in the\nmarket. Rather than focus exclusively on wrinkles as a product benefit,\nOlay broadened the value proposition.\n\nThe research showed that wrinkles were but one of many concerns.\nJoe Listro, Olay’s R&D vice president, notes, “Besides wrinkles, there\nwas dry skin, age spots, and uneven skin tone problems.

But the\ninfluence with,\nlittle experience\ncompany had precious\ndepartment stores, where it sold in just a few categories. To play to\nP&G’s strengths, it made sense to stay in mass channels, but only if\ndepartment store consumers would defect there for Olay. To win with\nOlay in mass, the company had to bridge the mass and prestige markets,\ncreating what it would come to call a masstige category. Olay needed to\nshift the perception of beauty care in the mass channel, selling higherend, more prestigious products\ntraditionally high-volume\nenvironment.

Recalls Listro, “Most\nproducts in mass, and even prestige to some extent, were sold either in\nsqueeze bottles or in generic jars. What we were looking for was a\ntechnology that could deliver a thick cream elegantly, more like a lotion.\nWe found this design that could actually pump creams.” The result: a\npackage that would look distinctive and impressive on the shelf, but also\nwork effectively once the product was at home.\n\nPricing was the next element. Traditionally, Olay products had sold,\nlike most drugstore brands, in the sub-$8 price category (compared with\ndepartment store brands, which could be priced anywhere from $25 to\n$400 or more). As Drosos explains, in skin care, there was the pervasive\nbelief “that you get what you pay for. Women felt the products available\nin the mass-market channel were just not as good.” Olay’s advertising\nand packaging promised a high-quality, effective product that could\ncompete with department store brands. Its pricing needed to hit the\nperfect note as well---not so high that mass consumers would be turned\noff, but not so low that prestige consumers would doubt its efficacy (no\nmatter what those independent experts said).\n\nListro recalls the testing that went on to determine the pricing strategy\nfor Olay Total Effects: “We started to test the new Olay product at\npremium price points of $12.99 to $18.99 and got very different results\nat those price points.” At $12.99, there was a positive response and a\nreasonably good rate of purchase intent (a stated intention to buy the\nproduct in the future). But most of the subjects who signaled a desire to\nbuy at $12.99 were mass shoppers. Very few department store shoppers\nwere interested at that price point. “Basically,” explains Listro, “we were\ntrading people up from within the channel.” That was good, but not\nenough. At $15.99, purchase intent dropped considerably. Then, at\n$18.99, purchase intent went back up again---way up. “So, $12.99 was\nreally good, $15.99 not so good, $18.99 great. We found that at $18.99,\nwe were starting to get consumers who would shop in both channels. At\n$18.99, it was a great value to a prestige shopper who was used to\nspending $30 or more.” The $18.99 price point was just below Clinique\nand considerably below Estée Lauder.

It was set as the manufacturer suggested retail price,\nand the team worked hard to convince retailers to stick to that price.\n\nMomentum started to build.

In terms of\nhow to win, she may have one approach for customers who are new to\nyoga and intimidated by all the choices (offering advice not just on attire\nbut on how to get started, as well as reassurance that it will all make\nsense in time), another for aficionados (highlighting the technical specs\nof the gear but also swapping stories about classes and instructors), and\nanother for the fashion crowd who seek yoga pants not for athletics but\nfor running errands (pointing out racks of new arrivals, emphasizing\nunique colors and designs). She chooses to develop her own capabilities\nin clear communication, understanding technical specs, and practicing\ndifferent forms of yoga. She builds her own management systems, like a\npersonal cheat sheet for products and styles and a directory of her\nfavorite local studios and instructors.\n\nThese frontline choices may not seem as complex as the choices\nfacing the CEO, but they are indeed strategic choices. Like the CEO, a\nsalesperson must make the best choices she can under constraints and\nuncertainty. Her constraints came from the choices made above her in the\norganization, from the demands of her customers, and from the strategies\nof her competitors. For the CEO, the constraints came from the\nexpectations of the capital markets, the company’s cash reserves, and the\ndirections of the board of directors. Both the salesperson and her CEO\nare making strategic choices and acting upon them---the only difference\nis the scope of the choices and the precise nature of the constraints.\n\nStrategy can be created and refined at every level of the organization\nusing the choice cascade framework.

A company must seek to win in a particular place\nand in a particular way. If it doesn’t seek to win, it is wasting the time of\nits people and the investments of its capital providers. But to be most\nhelpful, the abstract concept of winning should be translated into defined\naspirations. Aspirations are statements about the ideal future. At a later\nstage in the process, a company ties to those aspirations some specific\nbenchmarks that measure progress toward them.\n\nAt Olay, the winning aspirations were defined as market share\nleadership in North America, $1 billion in sales, and a global share that\nput the brand among the market leaders. A revitalized and transformed\nOlay was expected to establish skin care as a strong pillar for beauty\nalong with hair care. Establishing and maintaining leadership of a new\nmasstige segment, positioned between mass and prestige, was a third\naspiration. This set of aspirations served as a starting point to define\nwhere to play and how to win, enabling the Olay team to see the larger\npurpose in what it was doing. Clarity about the winning aspirations\nmeant that actions at the brand, category, sector, and company level were\ndirected at delivering against that ideal.\n\nAt the overall company level, winning was defined as delivering the\nmost valuable, value-creating brands in every category and industry in\nwhich P&G chose to compete (in other words, market leadership in all of\nP&G’s categories). The aspiration was to create sustainable competitive\nadvantage, superior value, and superior financial returns. P&G’s\nstatement of purpose, at the time, read as follows: “We will provide\nproducts and services of superior quality and value that improve the lives\nof the world’s consumers. As a result, consumers will reward us with\nleadership sales, profit and value creation, allowing our people, our\nshareholders, and the communities in which we live and work to\nprosper.” Improving consumers’ lives to drive leadership sales, profit,\nand value creation was the company’s most important aspiration. It drove\nall subsequent choices.\n\nAspirations can be refined and revised over time. However, aspirations\nshouldn’t change day to day; they exist to consistently align activities\nwithin the firm, so should be designed to last for some time. A definition\nof winning provides a context for the rest of the strategic choices; in all\ncases, choices should fit within and support the firm’s aspirations.

These two\nchoices, which are tightly bound up with one another, form the very\nheart of strategy and are the two most critical questions in strategy\nformulation. The winning aspiration broadly defines the scope of the\nfirm’s activities; where to play and how to win define the specific\nactivities of the organization---what the firm will do, and where and how\nit will do this, to achieve its aspirations.\n\nWhere to play represents the set of choices that narrow the\ncompetitive field. The questions to be asked focus on where the company\nwill compete---in which markets, with which customers and consumers,\nin which channels, in which product categories, and at which vertical\nstage or stages of the industry in question. This set of questions is vital;\nno company can be all things to all people and still win, so it is important\nto understand which where-to-play choices will best enable the company\nto win. A firm can be narrow or broad. It can compete in any number of\ndemographic segments (men ages eighteen to twenty-four, midlife\nurbanites, working moms) and geographies (local, national, international,\ndeveloped world, economically fast-advancing countries like Brazil and\nChina). It can compete in myriad services, product lines, and categories.\nIt can participate in different channels (direct to consumer, online, mass\nmerchandise, grocery, department store). It can participate in the\nupstream part of its industry, downstream, or be vertically integrated.\nThese choices, when taken together, capture the strategic playing field\nfor the firm.\n\nOlay made two strategically decisive where-to-play choices: to create,\nwith retail partners, a new masstige segment in mass discount stores,\ndrugstores, and grocery stores to compete with prestige brands and to\ndevelop a new and growing point-of-entry consumer segment for antiaging skin-care products. Many other where-to-play options were\nconsidered (like moving into prestige channels and selling through\ndepartment and specialty stores), but to win, Olay’s choices on where to\nplay needed to make sense in light of P&G’s company-level where-toplay choices and capabilities.

So,\nthe Olay team decided where to play with the P&G choices and\ncapabilities in mind.\n\nCorporately, when it came to where to play, the company needed to\ndefine which regions, categories, channels, and consumers would give\nP&G a sustainable competitive advantage. The idea was to play in those\nareas where P&G’s capabilities would be decisive and to avoid areas\nwhere they were not. The concept that helped P&G leaders sort one area\nfrom the other and to define the strategic playing field clearly was the\nidea of core.\n\nWe wanted to play where P&G’s core strengths would enable it to win.\nWe asked which brands truly were core brands, identifying a set of\nbrands that were clear industry or category leaders and devoting\nresources to them disproportionately. We asked what P&G’s core\ngeographies were. With ten countries representing 85 percent of profits,\nP&G had to focus on winning in those countries.

Economic\ngrowth in these markets will be as much as four times as high as in the\nOECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development)\ndeveloped markets. The question was how many markets P&G could\ntake on and in what priority order. The company started with China,\nMexico, and Russia, building capability and reach over time to include\nBrazil, India, and others. As Chip Bergh, former group president for\nglobal grooming and now CEO of Levi Strauss & Co., notes, “In 2000,\nabout 20 percent of P&G’s total sales were in emerging markets\ncompared to Unilever and Colgate, which were already up near 40\npercent. We were a company of premium-priced products, always going\nafter product superiority. We tended to play, as a company, in the\npremium tiers in almost all categories.”6 To compete in the developing\nworld, Bergh says, a change in orientation was required: “We needed to\nbegin broadening our portfolio and developing competitive propositions,\nincluding cost structures that would allow us to reach deeper into these\nemerging markets. There are a billion consumers in India, and we were\nreaching the top 10 percent of them.”\n\nEmerging markets would be an important where-to-play choice, but\nnot all emerging markets all at once.

Baby care in Asia, for instance, made great\nsense---since, for the foreseeable future, most of the world’s babies\nwould be born in Asia. Laundry and beauty also made sense in emerging\nmarkets, for reasons of brand equity, scale, and consumer preference. So,\nP&G sought to make inroads in Asia, in those three categories, and it\ndid.

It is the recipe for success in the chosen\nsegments, categories, channels, geographies, and so on. The how-to-win\nchoice is intimately tied to the where-to-play choice.

If he failed to do so,\nhe would likely fail to engage the new market. Where-to-play and howto-win choices must be considered together, because no how-to-win is\nperfect, or even appropriate, for all where-to-play choices.\n\nTo determine how to win, an organization must decide what will\nenable it to create unique value and sustainably deliver that value to\ncustomers in a way that is distinct from the firm’s competitors. Michael\nPorter called it competitive advantage---the specific way a firm utilizes\nits advantages to create superior value for a consumer or a customer and\nin turn, superior returns for the firm.\n\nFor Olay, the how-to-win choices were to formulate genuinely better\nskin-care products that could actually fight the signs of aging, to create a\npowerful marketing campaign that clearly articulated the brand promise\n(“Fight the Seven Signs of Aging”), and to establish a masstige channel,\nworking with mass retailers to compete directly with prestige brands.\nThe masstige choice, which was a decision to win in the channels P&G\nknew best, required significant changes in product formulation, package\ndesign, branding, and pricing to reframe the value proposition for\nretailers and consumers.\n\nCorporately, P&G chose to compete from the core; to extend into\nhome, beauty, health, and personal care; and to expand into emerging\nmarkets. The how-to-win choices needed to work optimally with these\nwhere-to-play choices. To be successful, how-to-win choices should be\nsuited to the specific context of the firm in question and highly difficult\nfor competitors to copy.

But winning is also hard. It takes hard choices, dedicated effort,\nand substantial investment. Lots of companies try to win and still can’t\ndo it.

The context is important, of\ncourse. In the 1950s, at the end of legendary chairman Alfred P. Sloan’s\ntenure, GM had more employees than did any other company in the\nworld and owned more than half of the US automotive market. It was the\nbiggest of the Big Three and, for a time, the greatest and most powerful\ncompany on earth. But Sloan retired. Tastes changed, partly in response\nto the oil shocks of the 1970s. An incursion of cheaper, fuel-efficient\nimports began\nlook old-fashioned and\nunaffordable.\n\nto make GM’s\n\nlineup\n\nBy the 1980s, GM’s core US brands---including Oldsmobile, Chevy,\nand Buick---were in decline. Younger car buyers were turning to Toyota,\nHonda, and Nissan, choosing these automakers’ smaller and more\neconomical models. Costs were a growing concern too; as GM’s\nunionized workforce aged, generous retiree benefits contributed to\nhigher and higher legacy costs---and those costs were passed on to car\nbuyers. Meanwhile, relations with the United Auto Workers were poor\nand not getting any better, as GM restructured operations, closed plants,\nshifted resources, and laid off tens of thousands of workers.", "source_file": "Playing_to_Win__How_Strategy_Really_Works_-_AG_Lafley.pdf", "extraction_method": "pdfminer", "ocr_used": false, "has_table": false, "chapter_num": null, "chapter_title": null, "section_num": null, "section_title": null}

Saturn---“a different\nkind of company, a different kind of car”---would be GM’s first new\nbrand in almost seventy years, and it marked the first time GM would\nuse a subsidiary, rather than a division, to make and sell cars. The goal,\nper then chairman Roger Smith, was to “sell a car at the lower end of the\nmarket and still make money.”1 In short, Saturn was GM’s answer to the\nJapanese imports that threatened to dominate the small-car market; it was\na defensive strategy, a way of playing in the small-car segment, designed\nto protect what remained of the ground GM was losing.\n\nGM set up a separate Saturn head office. It negotiated a simplified,\nflexible deal with the United Auto Workers for Saturn’s Spring Hill\nplant, guaranteeing workers greater control and profit sharing in\nexchange for lower base wages. Saturn also took a remarkably different\napproach to customer service, beginning with a no-haggle, one-price\npolicy at all its dealerships. At Saturn, “customers received personal\nattention usually found only in luxury showrooms ... As a matter of\npolicy, employees would drop what they were doing and cheer in the\nshowroom when a customer received the keys to a new Saturn.”2\nLaunched with much fanfare, Saturn looked to be GM’s silver bullet---\nthe innovative strategic initiative that would finally turn things around.\n\nAs it turns out, Saturn did not turn things around. Some twenty years\nand, by analyst estimates, $20 billion in losses later, Saturn is gone. The\ndivision was shuttered and all of its dealerships closed by the end of\n2010. GM, emerging from Chapter 11 bankruptcy, is now a shadow of its\nformer self, and its US market share is less than 20 percent.3 Launching\nSaturn didn’t cause GM’s bankruptcy, but it didn’t help much, either.\nSaturn vehicles, though they garnered loyalty from owners, never\nreached the critical mass needed to sustain a full lineup of cars or a\nnational dealer network. As one former GM director said of Saturn, “it\nmay well be the biggest fiasco in automotive history since Ford brought\nout the Edsel.”4\n\nThe folks running Saturn aspired to participate in the US small-car\nsegment with younger buyers.

Saturn died, not because it made bad\ncars, but because its aspirations were simply too modest to keep it alive.\nThe aspirations did not spur winning where-to-play and how-to-win\nchoices, capabilities, and management systems.\n\nTo be fair, GM had myriad challenges that made playing to win a\ndaunting prospect---troubling union relations, oppressive legacy healthcare and pension costs, and difficult dealer regulations. However, playing\nto play, rather than seeking to play to win, perpetuated the overall\ncorporate problems rather than overcoming them. Contrast the approach\nat GM to the approach at P&G, where the company plays to win\nwhenever it chooses to play. And the approach holds even in the\nunlikeliest of places. Playing to win is reasonably straightforward to\ncontemplate in a consumer market. But what does it look like for an\ninternal, shared-services function? Even there, you can play to win, as\nFilippo Passerini, president of P&G’s global business services (GBS)\nunit demonstrates.\n\nPlaying to Win\n\nAt the end of the dot-com bubble, the IT world was in turmoil. The\nNASDAQ had melted down, taking both the credibility of the high-tech\nindustry and the broader market indexes with it, throwing the economy\ninto a recession. Yet, despite the crash, it was clear that spending on IT\ninfrastructure and services would continue to increase. IT services were\nfar from a core competency for most companies (including P&G), and\nthe costs and complexities of providing IT services in-house were\ndaunting. Fortunately, riding to the rescue was a new breed of service\nprovider: the business process outsourcer (BPO). These companies\n(including IBM, EDS, Accenture, TCS, and Infosys) would provide a\nrange of IT services from the outside, managing complexity for a fee. As\nthe postcrash dust cleared, rapidly digitizing companies were faced with\ndecisions on how much to use BPOs, which BPO partner to select, and\nhow best to do so. It wasn’t easy; the implications of a poor choice could\nbe millions of dollars in extra costs and untold headaches down the line.\nAt P&G, many of the operations that might be outsourced had been\ngathered together in a 1999 reorganization. This GBS function was\nresponsible for business services including IT, facilities management,\nand employee services.

The stock markets and economy were\ncratering, as were the stock prices of the publicly traded BPOs. If\ncompleted, the deal would have been highly complex and at an\nunprecedented size for the global BPO industry. P&G had never\noutsourced or sold anything affecting this many employees, so the\nimpact on morale and culture was highly uncertain. As the options were\nmade known to employees, some employees feared the company would\nsell loyal P&G employees into “slavery.”\n\nThe easiest thing would have been to declare that the issue was too\ndivisive and to stick with the status quo. After all, GBS was working just\nfine. It was playing well in its space and delivering high-quality services\nto a wide range of internal customers. Alternatively, P&G could have\ngone with the next most conventional option: a single large deal with a\npremier BPO firm like IBM Global Services or EDS. Finally, the\ncompany could have acknowledged that a large, in-house global services\norganization was an inefficient use of P&G resources and spun out GBS\ninto its own BPO. Any of these choices might have seemed sensible\ngiven the circumstances. But none effectively answered the question of\nhow P&G could win with its global services.\n\nThe senior team wasn’t convinced that all of the options were on the\ntable. So, Filippo Passerini, who had a strong IT background and\nmarketing management experience, was asked to think through the\nexisting options and, if appropriate, suggest additional possibilities.\nPasserini struggled with the conventional choice. In theory, outsourcing\nto a single large BPO would create considerable economies of scale. It\nwas clear that the deal would be good for the BPO partner, which would\nsecure the biggest outsourcing deal in the industry’s history. But there\nwas no obvious reason why the deal would help P&G to win. P&G\nwanted more than cost-effectiveness and a commitment to a predefined\nservice level from an outsourcing deal. It wanted flexibility, a partner\nthat could and would innovate with P&G to create value that didn’t exist\nin the current structure.\n\nPasserini soon came up with a new option. Instead of signing one deal,\nP&G would outsource various GBS activities to best-of-breed BPO\npartners, finding one ideal partner to manage facilities, another to", "source_file": "Playing_to_Win__How_Strategy_Really_Works_-_AG_Lafley.pdf", "extraction_method": "pdfminer", "ocr_used": false, "has_table": false, "chapter_num": null, "chapter_title": null, "section_num": null, "section_title": null}

The logic of this best-of-breed\noption was that P&G’s needs are highly varied and that a variety of more\nspecialized partners would be most capable of meeting the needs.\nPasserini saw that specialization could increase the quality and lower the\ncost of BPO solutions, and believed that P&G could manage the\ncomplexity of multiple relationships to create more value than it could\nthrough one relationship. Plus, there was risk mitigation in having\nmultiple partners, and they could be benchmarked against one another to\npromote better performance. Finally, outsourcing would free up\nremaining GBS resources to invest in P&G core capabilities and build\nsustainable competitive advantage.\n\nThe case for a best-of-breed approach was compelling. In 2003, P&G\nentered BPO partnerships with Hewlett-Packard in IT support and\napplications, IBM Global Services in employee services, and Jones Lang\nLasalle in facilities management. Importantly, Passerini didn’t simply\nselect the biggest or best-known player in each BPO space. In fact, as he\nexplains, he chose partners considering another essential criterion: “For\neach one of them, there was a common denominator: interdependency. It\nplayed out in different ways. For HP, they were a distant fourth player in\nthe industry. With P&G, they gained instantaneous visibility and\ncredibility. As important as they are to us, because all of our systems\noperate on the HP platform now, we are equally important to them [as\ntheir lead customer]. For each one of the [best-in-breed partners], the\nbenefit was different, but each one of them became interdependent with\nP&G.”5 Passerini had crafted a richer way of thinking about the BPO\nrelationship, one that asked, under what conditions can we help each\nother win?\n\nPasserini’s approach has been a success. The\n\nthree original\npartnerships have performed well and have led to a handful of deeper\npartnerships for different services. The cost of services has fallen.\nMeanwhile, quality has risen and service levels have improved.\nSatisfaction rates for the six thousand employees who transferred to the\nBPO partners went up too; they are now a core part of their new\norganizations rather than a noncore part of P&G. And the approach has\nfreed up P&G’s GBS team members to focus on innovating and building\nIT systems that support P&G strategic choices and capabilities, like\ndesigning state-of-the-art virtual shopping experiences for consumer\ninsights work and a desktop-based “cockpit” that provides P&G leaders\nwith at-a-glance decision-making tools.

But the\naspiration was considerably higher. The questions asked were these:\nWhat choice would help P&G win? And how could that choice create\nsustainable competitive advantage? These questions continue to be\nasked. Now head of a more agile GBS organization, Passerini thinks\nabout providing service to P&G in terms of creating a winning value\nequation. “I fear becoming a commodity,” he says. “[In IT] you need to\nbe distinctive to avoid commoditization. We have been on a quest to\ndeliver unique value to P&G. Whatever is distinctive and unique, we\nfocus on; whatever is commodity, because there is not competitive\nadvantage in doing it inside, we outsource.”\n\nThe desire to win spurs a helpfully competitive mind-set, a desire to\ndo better whenever possible. For this reason, GBS competes for its\ninternal customers. Passerini explains: “We don’t mandate new services;\nwe offer them [to businesses and functions] at a cost. If the business\nunits like them, they will buy them. If they don’t like them, they will\npass.” This open market provides important feedback and keeps GBS\nthinking about how to win with its internal customers and create new\nvalue. So much so that Passerini famously stood at a global leadership\nteam meeting and promised: “Give me anything I can turn into a service,\nand I’ll save you seventeen cents on the dollar.” It was a provocative\noffer, and one that set the tone for his team. Good enough wasn’t an\noption. Providing services wasn’t the strategy. Providing better services\nat higher quality and lower costs---while serving as an innovation engine\nfor the company---was the strategy. It was a strategy aimed at winning.\n\nWith Those Who Matter Most\n\nTo set aspirations properly, it is important to understand who you are\nwinning with and against.

From the 1970s to\nthe 1990s, television commercials featuring Nancy Walker as a diner\nwaitress (and paper towel aficionado) named Rosie established the paper\ntowel brand in the hearts and minds of consumers. The ads’ tagline\n---“The quicker picker-upper”---was as well known as American\nExpress’s “Don’t leave home without it” or Maxwell House’s “Good to\nthe last drop.” A proprietary technology advantage meant that Bounty\nreally was more absorbent than competitive brands, and it became the\nleading paper towel brand in North America. Even after Rosie retired,\nthe brand continued to grow, adding a share point per year, like\nclockwork.\n\nBut by the late 1990s, the Bounty business was struggling. North\nAmerica had always been Bounty’s best and biggest market, but as P&G\nfocused on a globalization agenda, the tissue and towel team (which was\nresponsible for Bounty, Charmin toilet paper, and Puffs facial tissues)\nhad embarked on a global buying spree, acquiring brands and\nmanufacturing capacity in Europe, Asia, and Latin America. The\nacquisitions consumed cash and constrained growth and profitability in\nthe core US market. By the time Charlie Pierce came on as president of\nglobal family care (the renamed tissue and towel business) in 2001, it\nwas time to change course. As Pierce puts it, “I think my job was to\ndeclare crisis.”1\n\nThe global expansion was clearly problematic, but so too was the lack\nof strategic focus, particularly in R&D. The family-care team, inspired\nby corporate stretch goals to think big, was working on tangential, whitespace ideas, like plastic-wrap technology, food containers, and paper", "source_file": "Playing_to_Win__How_Strategy_Really_Works_-_AG_Lafley.pdf", "extraction_method": "pdfminer", "ocr_used": false, "has_table": false, "chapter_num": null, "chapter_title": null, "section_num": null, "section_title": null}

These new products might turn out to be worthy initiatives, but\nthey had little connection to better paper towels, toilet paper, and facial\ntissue. Some of the team had come to believe that global family care\ncould never get great financial returns from the structurally unattractive\ntissue and towel business, so it looked to other products and segments for\ngrowth. Pierce recalls his initial reaction: “If it is true that we can’t get a\ndecent return from the existing business, we should get out of the\nbusiness entirely.”\n\nWas it true? P&G had made corporate where-to-play choices to grow\nin and from the core; to extend into home-care, beauty, health, and\npersonal-care categories; and to build presence in emerging markets.\nAcross these choices, P&G believed it could win through its ability to\nunderstand core consumers, by creating and building differentiated\nbrands, and through R&D, innovative product design, global scale, and\nstrong partnerships with both suppliers and channel customers. All of\nthis presented a challenge for family care. In Europe, Asia, and Latin\nAmerica, manufacturing overcapacity and private-label dominance were\nturning the category into a commodity. In emerging markets, prices and\nwillingness to pay were so low that brand differentiation conferred little\nto no advantage. A niche strategy in emerging markets---to target just\nthose few customers who valued premium performance---was nearly\nimpossible because the capital requirements to make paper products\nmean a business must have substantial scale to be economical. Yet, the\nidea of building a truly global tissue and towel business was untenable.\n\nThe good news was that the business could be structurally attractive in\nNorth America; P&G could have a billion-dollar leadership brand with\nsignificant manufacturing economies of scale from North American sales\nalone. The family-care team could pare back and choose to play only in\nNorth America, in the top half of the market and, over time, sell off its\nassets in the rest of the world. Paring back was a choice P&G had made\nbefore. The company had chosen to enter or stay in categories that were\ngenerally unattractive structurally, but it had played in only the\npotentially attractive segments, working hard on pricing, capital and\noperating expenses, product and package design, operating costs, and\nscale. Laundry care, feminine care, and fine fragrances had all been\nwritten off as unwinnable categories, before P&G found a way to play to\nits strengths in only the most attractive segments.

When the\nwhere-to-play choice was a global one, the innovation team had logically\ndecided to pursue a series of new products and categories, like food\ncontainers and paper cups, that were outside the core of paper towels and\ntissues. Given the unattractive nature of the global tissue and towel\nbusinesses, it made some sense to test potentially more profitable\nproduct categories. But this approach meant that instead of innovating on\nits existing products, the team was chasing more-speculative product\ncategories. Once the geographic choice was narrowed, family care could\nreorient the product where-to-play choice back to the core business,\nfocusing on improving its competitive position in paper towels and bath\nand facial tissue. It could focus on Bounty, Charmin, and Puffs again.\n\nThe team began with Bounty and with consumers. Deep consumer\nunderstanding is at the heart of the strategy discussion. To be effective,\nstrategy must be rooted in a desire to meet user needs in a way that\ncreates value for both the company and the consumer. In considering\nwhere to play among consumer segments, the Bounty team asked some\ncritical questions: Who is the consumer? What is the job to be done?\nWhy do consumers choose what they do, relative to the job to be done?\nBounty had tremendous awareness and brand equity in the North\nAmerican marketplace. “It had by far the best equity in its category---one\nof the strongest brand equities in the company,” says Pierce. “If you\nasked, virtually 100 percent of people would say Bounty is a great brand\nand a really good product. Then some would go off and buy something\nelse. What’s wrong with this picture?” Pierce and his team set out to\ntruly understand consumer needs, habits, and practices as they relate to\npaper towels.\n\nIn watching and talking to consumers, they found that there were three\ndistinct types of paper towel users. The first group cared about both\nstrength and absorbency. For this group, Bounty was a perfect fit---a\ngreat combination of the two attributes they cared most about. The team\nfound that among these consumers, Bounty was already the clear winner.\nHere, “Bounty didn’t have a forty share,” Pierce says. “It had an eighty\nshare.”\n\nBut many consumers didn’t fit into the strength-and-absorbency\ncategory; those consumers fell squarely into the remaining two segments.\nThe second segment consisted of consumers who wanted a paper towel\nwith a cloth-like feel. They didn’t care much about strength or\nabsorbency, certainly much less than the core Bounty group did.

{"segment_id": "00062", "page_num": 62, "segment": "this group of customers cared about how soft the paper towel felt in their\nhand. The final segment had price as their top priority, though not as\ntheir sole concern, says Pierce: “The need of those consumers was also\non strength. It wasn’t at all on absorbency, because they had a\ncompensating behavior to address the absorbency shortfalls of lowerpriced paper-towel products: they would simply use more sheets.” These\nconsumers were happy to use more sheets of a lower-priced paper towel,\nwhen needed, rather than spend more money for a premium brand that\nenabled the use of fewer sheets each time. It was a trade-off that made\ngood sense to them.\n\nBounty had captured most of the first consumer segment, but had\nmade few inroads with the other two groups. Pierce wanted to play in all\nthree segments to achieve more scale and enhance profitability. Going\nforward, Bounty would become not one but three distinct products---\neach one designed to target a specific consumer segment. Traditional\nBounty would remain unchanged and serve the first segment, which\nalready loved the brand. A new product called Bounty Extra Soft would\ntarget the consumers who craved a soft, cloth-like feel. And then there\nwas\nfinal segment---the strength-and-price segment. These\nconsumers presented something of a challenge.\n\nthe\n\nMost of the lower-priced paper towels on the market were of poor\nquality, and the Bounty team didn’t want to devalue the core brand by\nassociating it with a subpar product. “Those products fail miserably on\nstrength,” Pierce notes. “They shred, they tear. They disintegrate in the\nface of a spill. Then, you not only have to deal with the spill, but you\nalso have the mess of the towel residue to deal with.” To have the\nBounty name---even at a value price point---a product would have to live\nup to the equity of the Bounty brand. The new offering for the strengthand-price segment was designed not as a stripped-down version of\nBounty, but as a new product with specific consumer needs in mind.\nBounty Basic was considerably stronger than any other value brand and\npriced at about 75 percent of the cost of regular Bounty. Shelved away\nfrom traditional Bounty, with the other lower-priced brands, it spoke\ndirectly to the third segment of consumers.\n\nWhile there was some concern that existing Bounty consumers might\ntrade down to Bounty Basic, the relative attributes of the three products\nfit each segment’s needs so perfectly that little shifting actually occurred.\nPierce notes, “The old Bounty was one product that existed for decades.\nThe modern-day Bounty is now three products that were designed", "source_file": "Playing_to_Win__How_Strategy_Really_Works_-_AG_Lafley.pdf", "extraction_method": "pdfminer", "ocr_used": false, "has_table": false, "chapter_num": null, "chapter_title": null, "section_num": null, "section_title": null}

By staying in the noncommodity space, in\nterms of both product assortment and price point, P&G can target its core\nconsumers through its most valued core retailers (its best and biggest\ncustomers), levering core advantages in innovation and brand building.\nPierce and his team made where-to-play choices on geography (North\nAmerica), consumers (three segments in the top half of the market),\nproducts (paper towels, branded basic and premium), channels (grocery\nstores, mass discounters, drugstores, and membership club stores like\nCostco), and stages of production (R&D and production of the paper\ntowel itself, but not growing, harvesting, or pulping the trees). Making\nthese clear where-to-play choices, for Bounty and the family-care\ncategory, spurred innovation and helped powerful brands grow even\nstronger. As a result, P&G family care consistently delivered business\ngrowth and value creation at industry-leading levels.\n\nThe Importance of the Right Playing Field\n\nThe choice of where to play defines the playing field for the company (or\nbrand, or category, etc.). It is a question of what business you are really\nin. It is a choice about where to compete and where not to compete.\nUnderstanding this choice is crucial, because the playing field you\nchoose is also the place where you will need to find ways to win. Whereto-play choices occur across a number of domains, notably these:\n\nGeography. In what countries or regions will you seek to\ncompete?\n\nProduct type. What kinds of products and services will you offer?\n\nConsumer segment. What groups of consumers will you target? In\nwhich price tier? Meeting which consumer needs?\n\nDistribution channel. How will you reach your customers? What\nchannels will you use?", "source_file": "Playing_to_Win__How_Strategy_Really_Works_-_AG_Lafley.pdf", "extraction_method": "pdfminer", "ocr_used": false, "has_table": false, "chapter_num": null, "chapter_title": null, "section_num": null, "section_title": null}
{"segment_id": "00064", "page_num": 64, "segment": "Vertical stage of production. In what stages of production will you\nengage? Where along the value chain? How broadly or narrowly?\n\nMany individual considerations need to go into the comprehensive\nwhere-to-play choice. And the considerations are the same, no matter the\nsize of the company or type of industry. Think of a small farmer. He\nmust answer a number of questions to get a clear sense of his playing\nfield. Will he sell only locally or to his friends and neighbors, or will he\nattempt to join a co-op that has a larger geographic footprint? Which\nfruits and vegetables will he grow? Will he sell organic products or\nstandard ones? Will he sell bushels of fruit unprocessed or process apples\ninto juice before selling them? Will he sell direct to consumers, or\nthrough a warehouse middleman? If he does process the fruit into juice,\nwill he do that himself or outsource that phase of production? If he is\nthoughtful, the farmer will consider where to play in a manner that\nenables him to choose geographies, segments, products, channels, and\nproduction options that work well together (e.g., selling organic veggies\nlocally at farmer’s markets or processing fruit to sell nationally while\nminimizing spoilage).\n\nStart-ups, small businesses, regional or national companies, and even\nhuge multinationals all face an analogous set of where-to-play choices.\nThe answers, of course, differ. Small businesses may well have narrower\nwhere-to-play choices than larger companies do, largely as a function of\ncapacity and scale. But even the largest companies must make explicit\nchoices to compete in some places, with some products, for some\ncustomers (and not in others). A choice to serve everyone, everywhere---\nor to simply serve all comers---is a losing choice.\n\nChoosing where to play is also about choosing where not to play. This\nis more straightforward when you are considering where to expand (or\nnot), but considerably harder when considering if you should stay in the\nplaces and segments you currently serve. The status quo---continuing on\nin the locations and segments you’ve always been---is all too often an\nimplicit, unexamined choice. Simply because you have made a given\nwhere-to-play choice in the past is not a reason to stay there. Consider a\ncompany like General Electric. A decade ago, it derived considerable\nrevenue from its entertainment holdings (NBC and Universal) and\nmaterials businesses (plastic and silicon).

This was an explicit choice about where not to\nplay.\n\nInevitably, the significance of each dimension of the where-to-play\nchoice will vary by context. Each dimension must be considered\nthoughtfully and will hold different weight in different situations. A\nstart-up might focus first on the products or services to be offered. A\nstagnating giant might focus on customers---looking for a deeper\nunderstanding of needs and new ways to approach segmentation---to\nnarrow and refine an overly broad where-to-play choice.\n\nAt P&G, where to play choices start with the consumer: Who is she?\nWhat does the consumer want and need? To win with mom, P&G invests\nheavily in truly understanding her---through observation, through home\nvisits, through a significant investment in uncovering unmet and\nunexpressed needs. Only through a concerted effort to understand the\nconsumer, her needs, and the way in which P&G can best serve those\nneeds is it possible to effectively determine where to play---which\nbusinesses to enter or leave, which products to sell, which markets to\nprioritize, and so on. As current CEO Bob McDonald explains, “We\ndon’t give lip service to consumer understanding. We dig deep. We\nimmerse ourselves in people’s day-to-day lives. We work hard to find the\ntensions that we can help resolve. From those tensions come insights that\nlead to big ideas.”2 Those big ideas can be the basis of a powerful whereto-play choice.\n\nThe distribution channel choice also tends to loom large for P&G,\nbecause of the dominant size and market power of the retailers in\nquestion. Tesco has more than 30 percent of the UK market.3 Walmart\nserves some 200 million Americans every week.4 Other players, like\nLoblaw in Canada or Carrefour in Europe, have substantial regional\npresence. For this reason, channel is a particularly crucial where-to-play\nconsideration for the company. Of course, for some industries, there is no\nreal channel consideration (e.g., in service industries that deal directly\nwith the end consumer). Again, context matters---and each company\nmust assess the weight of the different where-to-play choices for itself.\n\nOne final consideration for where to play is the competitive set. Just as\nit does when it defines winning aspirations, a company should make its\nwhere-to-play choices with the competition firmly in mind. Choosing a\nplaying field identical to a strong competitor’s can be a less attractive\nproposition than tacking away to compete in a different way, for different\ncustomers, or in different product lines.

But P&G didn’t need to\nsteal Wisk users to win in the category, at least not right away. The highprofile launch of Liquid Tide helped expand the overall liquid-detergent\ncategory, and P&G picked up the lion’s share of the expansion. Liquid\nTide created new consumers for liquid detergent, and none of them had a\nloyalty to Wisk. As the category grew, Tide could begin to take share\nfrom smaller players, like Dynamo, which couldn’t compete with P&G’s\nR&D, scale, and brand-building expertise. Only then, having built\ncritical mass, would Liquid Tide need to go after Wisk directly. At that\npoint, the battle was all but won.\n\nFor Liquid Tide, it wasn’t a matter of avoiding a playing field that held\na fierce competitor. It was about expanding the playing field to make\nroom for the two competitors and creating time to gain momentum. In\nthe end, Liquid Tide won and took the market lead decisively.\n\nThree Dangerous Temptations\n\nto channels and customers;\n\nAs we’ve noted, there is a lot to consider when crafting a winning whereto\nto-play choice, from consumers\ncompetition; to local, regional, and global differences. In the face of that\nkind of complexity, your\nto\noversimplification, resignation, even desperation. In particular, you\nshould avoid three pitfalls when thinking about where to play. The first is\nto refuse to choose, attempting to play in every field all at once. The\nsecond is to attempt to buy your way out of an inherited and unattractive\nchoice. The third is to accept a current choice as inevitable or\n\nstrategy can easily\n\nfall prey", "source_file": "Playing_to_Win__How_Strategy_Really_Works_-_AG_Lafley.pdf", "extraction_method": "pdfminer", "ocr_used": false, "has_table": false, "chapter_num": null, "chapter_title": null, "section_num": null, "section_title": null}

Giving in to any one of these temptations leads to weak\nstrategic choices and, often, to failure.\n\nFailing to Choose\n\nFocus is a crucial winning attribute. Attempting to be all things to all\ncustomers tends to result in underserving everyone. Even the strongest\ncompany or brand will be positioned to serve some customers better than\nothers. If your customer segment is “everyone” or your geographic\nchoice is “everywhere,” you haven’t truly come to grips with the need to\nchoose. But, you may argue, don’t companies like Apple and Toyota\nchoose to serve everyone? No, not really. While they do have very large\ncustomer bases, the companies don’t serve all parts of the world and all\ncustomer segments equally. As late as 2009, Apple derived just 2 percent\nof its revenue from China. That was a choice---about where and when to\nplay. It was a choice based on resources, capabilities, and an\nunderstanding that even Apple can’t be everywhere at once.\n\nP&G, too, can’t serve all markets equally well. With Bounty, it chose\nto target three segments of consumers in the top end of the North\nAmerican paper towel market; it chose not to serve the rest of the world\nor consumers for whom price was the primary decision criteria. For P&G\noverall, in choosing where to play in emerging markets, the focus was on\nregions where it had an established business (like Mexico) and where\nnew markets opened equally to all comers at the same time (e.g., Eastern\nEurope right after the fall of the Berlin Wall and China when Deng\nXiaoping opened the first enterprise zones in Guangzhou City). The\ndecision to focus on a very few emerging markets at a time enabled P&G\nto prioritize resource allocation, cash, and, most importantly, people,\nagainst moving up the learning curve and establishing successful\nbusinesses. Without such an explicit choice, P&G would have wound up\nwith a mix of middling businesses scattered around the world, all starved\nfor the attention and resources needed to become a market leader.\n\nTrying to Buy Your Way Out of an Unattractive Game\n\nCompanies often attempt to move out of an unattractive game and into\nan attractive one through acquisition.

Whether in\naluminum, newsprint, or coal, an acquirer is often seduced by the idea of\naccess to the higher prices and faster growth rates of a downstream\nindustry. Unfortunately, there are two big problems with this kind of\nacquisition. The first is price. It costs a great deal to buy into attractive\nindustries---quite often, acquirers must pay more than the asset could\never be worth to them, which dooms the acquirer in the long run.\nSecond, the strategy and capabilities required in the targeted industry are\noften very different from those in the current industry; it is seriously\ntough sledding to bridge the two approaches and have an advantage in\nboth (in mining bauxite and processing aluminum, for instance).

The real goal\nshould be to create an internal discipline of strategic thinking that\nenables a more thoughtful approach to the current game, regardless of\nindustry, and connects to possible different futures and opportunities.\n\nAccepting an Existing Choice as Immutable\n\nIt can also be tempting to view a where-to-play choice as a given, as\nhaving been made for you. But a company always has a choice of where\nto play. To return to a favorite example, Apple wasn’t bound entirely by\nits first where-to-play choice---which was desktop computers. Though it\neventually established a comfortable niche in that world, as the desktop\nof choice for creative industries, Apple chose to change its playing field\nto move into the portable communication and entertainment space with\nthe iPod, iTunes, iPhone, and iPad.\n\nIt is tempting to think that you have no choice in where to play,\nbecause it makes for a great excuse for mediocre performance. It is not\neasy to change playing fields, but it is doable and can make all the\ndifference. Sometimes the change is subtle, like a shift in consumer\nfocus within a current industry---as with Olay.

We’ve already\nseen the Olay where-to-play choice and how it changed over time.\nRather than attempting to deliver products to all women, in all age\ncategories, at the lower end of the market, the Olay team chose to\ncompete primarily on a narrower field---women aged thirty-five-plus\nwho were newly concerned with the signs of aging. This was just one of\nmany possible choices for the brand, an explicit narrowing and shifting\nof the previous where-to-play choice. Then there is one of P&G’s biggest\nbrands: Tide.

As late as the 1980s, Tide had two forms---the\ntraditional washing powder and the liquid version---both geared at\ngetting the visible dirt out of your clothes (“Tide’s in, Dirt’s out”). P&G\nbroadened its where-to-play choice for Tide by moving beyond visible\ndirt. Tide introduced product versions designed to address a whole range\nof cleaning needs---Tide with Bleach, Tide Plus a Touch of Downy, Tide\nPlus Febreze, Tide for Coldwater, Tide Unscented; then, P&G expanded\nthe Tide offering from detergents to other laundry-related products---\ncreating a line of stain-release products, most notably the highly\nsuccessful Tide-to-Go instant stain remover.

In this way, Tide\nbroadened to get stronger.\n\nImagining a New Where to Play\n\nSometimes the key to finding a new place to play is to simply believe\nthat one is possible. In 1995, Chip Bergh was appointed general manager\nfor P&G’s US hard-surface cleaners business. Bergh reflects, with a\nlaugh, “It sounds like a very nonelegant, unsexy business, and that’s\nexactly what it was. It was not a strategic priority in the company. But\ninterestingly, for all of our competitors, it was a core business. We knew\nour CEO never rolled out of bed and thought about this business. But for\nour competitors, every morning when the CEO was getting out of bed, he\nwas worrying about this business.”5 The competitive landscape was\nchallenging. Bergh’s brands included past-their-prime names like Comet,\nSpic ’n Span, and Mr. Clean. It was, Bergh notes, “about a $200 million\nbusiness at the time, and it was in free fall.” At one point in the mid1970s, Comet had enjoyed a 50 percent market share of the category. By\n1995, all of P&G’s brands in this category, combined, had less than 20\npercent of the market.\n\nTimes had changed, and P&G had failed to change with them. There\nwere fewer hard surfaces in homes, as fiberglass (and porous marbles\nand other stones) replaced porcelain. Competitors had introduced less\nabrasive cleansers that resonated with consumers; P&G had not. “It was\nclear we had to do something very, very different,” Bergh notes. “We\nrealized that our products were no longer relevant for the consumer and\nthat we had been out-innovated.”\n\nSo Bergh challenged his team to think about where to play from an\nentirely new perspective that would be grounded in an understanding of\nthe competitive landscape and of P&G’s core capabilities. “I took my\nleadership team off-site for two days,” he says. “The focus was to come\nup with a set of choices that would make a difference on the business.\nThe rallying cry we had around the new choices, and around the new\nstrategy, was to fundamentally change the game of cleaning at home and\nmake cleaning less of a chore.” As ever, the starting point was consumer\nneeds---like quick surface cleaning without muss and fuss, addressing a\nparticular job and doing it better than current offerings.

The\nkey breakthrough for us was to start putting together different\ntechnologies that P&G had, but our competitors didn’t. How do you\nmarry chemistry, surfactant technology, and paper technology?

And as competition enters into the category it created, P&G\nis turning its attention to the next strategic frontier for Swiffer, asking\nwhat’s next.\n\nDigging Deeper\n\nIt can be easy to dismiss new and different where-to-play choices as\nrisky, as a poor fit with the current business, or as misaligned with core\ncapabilities. And it is just as easy to write off an entire industry on the\nbasis of the predominant where-to-play choices made by the competitors\nin that industry. But sometimes, you must dig a bit deeper---to examine\nunexpected where-to-play choices from all sides---to truly understand\nwhat is possible and how an industry can be won with a new place to\nplay. This was the case with fine fragrances at P&G.\n\nThe P&G fine-fragrance business had an inauspicious start. In fact,\nP&G’s entry into the category was accidental. In 1991, the company\nacquired Max Factor to bolster the international reach of its color\ncosmetics business (entered in 1989 with the purchase of Noxell, the\nparent company that owned Cover Girl). Cover Girl was exclusively a\nNorth American brand at the time. Max Factor’s cosmetics business was\nprimarily outside North America and thus was a nice, logical fit. As it\nturned out, Max Factor had a tiny fragrance line---so now, P&G was in\nthe fine-fragrance business too. In 1994, then chairman and CEO, Ed\nArtzt, acted to deepen P&G’s participation in the fine-fragrance business\nwith the purchase of Giorgio of Beverly Hills for $150 million. At the\ntime, most thought it was a strange acquisition---staid, Midwestern P&G\nbuying a chic Rodeo Drive perfumery.\n\nIn many ways, it was an odd mix.

Very little of P&G’s\nthe\nbrand-building expertise appeared\nreputations of these fashion brands were highly volatile. They waxed and\nwaned, and there seemed to be little that the brands could do (and even\nless that P&G could do) about it. Very, very few perfume brands endured\nand grew for decades, as Tide and Crest had done. Fragrances were also\nsold substantially through a channel in which P&G was otherwise not\npresent---department stores and perfumeries. And finally, P&G’s R&D\nlabs couldn’t easily develop streams of innovation of the sort that kept\nBounty and Pantene ahead of their competitors. Fine fragrances felt more\nlike the hope-in-a-bottle business: lots of hype and little real technology.\nThe strategic choices and capabilities for fine fragrances had little in\ncommon with the choices for most other P&G businesses. No surprise,\nthen, that the fragrance business struggled along during the 1990s,\nunderperforming relative to the industry and to P&G’s company\nstandards.\n\nOn the surface at least, fine fragrances looked like an obvious choice\nfor divestiture. The business appeared to have a tenuous fit with the\nbroader P&G. What’s more, it had these complicating features---fashionhouse dependence and tricky distribution. P&G had no road map for\nrunning businesses like this internally, and there wasn’t a good analog on\nthe outside to benchmark against. P&G hadn’t been in the portfolio for\nvery long, especially in its post-Giorgio format, so there wasn’t much of\na track record either. The company came very close to divesting the\nbusiness but instead reframed the thinking.\n\nFine fragrances, however, were important to hang on to, for two\nstrategic reasons. First, a fine-fragrance presence was an important\ncomponent of a credible and competitive beauty business. P&G wanted\nto be a beauty leader, on the strength of hair care (Pantene, Head &\nShoulders) and skin care (Olay). But to be truly credible with the\nindustry and consumers as a beauty player, the company needed a\nposition in cosmetics and fragrances as well. The knowledge transfer\nbetween the different categories is significant, meaning that what you\nlearn in cosmetics and fragrances---through both product R&D and\nconsumer research---has a lot of spillover into hair care and skin care,", "source_file": "Playing_to_Win__How_Strategy_Really_Works_-_AG_Lafley.pdf", "extraction_method": "pdfminer", "ocr_used": false, "has_table": false, "chapter_num": null, "chapter_title": null, "section_num": null, "section_title": null}

In other words, just being in the fragrance business\nmakes you better in beauty categories overall.\n\nIn addition, fragrance is a very important part of the hair-care\nexperience---scent alone can significantly influence consumer product\npreferences. And it isn’t just true in hair care, which leads to the second\nstrategic reason to play in fine fragrances: in many household and other\npersonal-care businesses, there were significant consumer segments that\ncared deeply about the sensory experience. P&G could affect consumer\npurchase intent with the right fragrance. It soon became clear that\nfragrance was an important part of creating delightful consumer\nexperiences and that P&G was the biggest fragrance user in the world.\nThis little fine-fragrance business was important well beyond its existing\nsize; it was crucial to building core capabilities and systems that could\ndifferentiate and create competitive advantage for brands and products\nacross the entire corporation.\n\nSo P&G not only held on to the fine-fragrances business, but also built\nit strategically. P&G turned the industry business model inside out by\nmaking a totally different set of strategic where-to-play and how-to-win\nchoices. Within the fine-fragrances industry, there was a well-established\nway to do business: new fragrances were pushed out of the fashion\nstudios and fragrance houses, down the fashion runway, and into\ndepartment stores at Christmas time. Most new fragrance brands were\nlaunched for holiday shopping and began to decline by the next spring. It\nwas a push-and-churn model. And in most cases, it was secondary to\nanother, primary business: fashion.\n\nBy contrast, P&G started with the consumer, hiring its own internal\nteam of master perfumers to design fragrances against specific consumer\nwants and needs, as well as brand concepts. It partnered with the very\nbest fragrance-house perfumers and designers. Before long, P&G\nbecame the preferred innovation partner in the fine-fragrance space.\nP&G brands are consumer-centric, concept-led, and designed to delight\nconsumers. As it dedicated time and attention to the fine-fragrance\nbusiness, P&G attracted the best agency partners and won numerous\nawards for advertising, marketing, and packaging. It built product\nportfolios that expanded and strengthened its consumer user base. It built\nbrands that became leaders in their segments.\n\nAnother norm for the fragrance industry was to compete most\naggressively within the high-end women’s market.

It used P&G brand-building expertise to assess the\nstrength and value of brands to determine which fashion brands to\nlicense and how much to pay for them. It used an understanding of the\ndiscipline of strategy to match its choices with the choices of the\nlicensors, creating greater value for both. On the innovation front, worldleading expertise with scents enabled P&G to create licensed-brand\nproducts that were uniquely appealing to consumers and that could last\nbeyond a season.

All of\nthis presented a challenge for family care. In Europe, Asia, and Latin\nAmerica, manufacturing overcapacity and private-label dominance were\nturning the category into a commodity. In emerging markets, prices and\nwillingness to pay were so low that brand differentiation conferred little\nto no advantage. A niche strategy in emerging markets---to target just\nthose few customers who valued premium performance---was nearly\nimpossible because the capital requirements to make paper products\nmean a business must have substantial scale to be economical. Yet, the\nidea of building a truly global tissue and towel business was untenable.\n\nThe good news was that the business could be structurally attractive in\nNorth America; P&G could have a billion-dollar leadership brand with\nsignificant manufacturing economies of scale from North American sales\nalone. The family-care team could pare back and choose to play only in\nNorth America, in the top half of the market and, over time, sell off its\nassets in the rest of the world. Paring back was a choice P&G had made\nbefore. The company had chosen to enter or stay in categories that were\ngenerally unattractive structurally, but it had played in only the\npotentially attractive segments, working hard on pricing, capital and\noperating expenses, product and package design, operating costs, and\nscale. Laundry care, feminine care, and fine fragrances had all been\nwritten off as unwinnable categories, before P&G found a way to play to\nits strengths in only the most attractive segments. In each case, choosing\nwhere to play explicitly involved choosing where not to play as well, all\nwithin an overall industry structure.", "source_file": "Playing_to_Win__How_Strategy_Really_Works_-_AG_Lafley.pdf", "extraction_method": "pdfminer", "ocr_used": false, "has_table": false, "chapter_num": null, "chapter_title": null, "section_num": null, "section_title": null}

When the\nwhere-to-play choice was a global one, the innovation team had logically\ndecided to pursue a series of new products and categories, like food\ncontainers and paper cups, that were outside the core of paper towels and\ntissues. Given the unattractive nature of the global tissue and towel\nbusinesses, it made some sense to test potentially more profitable\nproduct categories. But this approach meant that instead of innovating on\nits existing products, the team was chasing more-speculative product\ncategories. Once the geographic choice was narrowed, family care could\nreorient the product where-to-play choice back to the core business,\nfocusing on improving its competitive position in paper towels and bath\nand facial tissue. It could focus on Bounty, Charmin, and Puffs again.\n\nThe team began with Bounty and with consumers. Deep consumer\nunderstanding is at the heart of the strategy discussion. To be effective,\nstrategy must be rooted in a desire to meet user needs in a way that\ncreates value for both the company and the consumer. In considering\nwhere to play among consumer segments, the Bounty team asked some\ncritical questions: Who is the consumer? What is the job to be done?\nWhy do consumers choose what they do, relative to the job to be done?\nBounty had tremendous awareness and brand equity in the North\nAmerican marketplace. “It had by far the best equity in its category---one\nof the strongest brand equities in the company,” says Pierce. “If you\nasked, virtually 100 percent of people would say Bounty is a great brand\nand a really good product. Then some would go off and buy something\nelse. What’s wrong with this picture?” Pierce and his team set out to\ntruly understand consumer needs, habits, and practices as they relate to\npaper towels.\n\nIn watching and talking to consumers, they found that there were three\ndistinct types of paper towel users. The first group cared about both\nstrength and absorbency. For this group, Bounty was a perfect fit---a\ngreat combination of the two attributes they cared most about. The team\nfound that among these consumers, Bounty was already the clear winner.\nHere, “Bounty didn’t have a forty share,” Pierce says. “It had an eighty\nshare.”\n\nBut many consumers didn’t fit into the strength-and-absorbency\ncategory; those consumers fell squarely into the remaining two segments.\nThe second segment consisted of consumers who wanted a paper towel\nwith a cloth-like feel. They didn’t care much about strength or\nabsorbency, certainly much less than the core Bounty group did.

The final segment had price as their top priority, though not as\ntheir sole concern, says Pierce: “The need of those consumers was also\non strength. It wasn’t at all on absorbency, because they had a\ncompensating behavior to address the absorbency shortfalls of lowerpriced paper-towel products: they would simply use more sheets.” These\nconsumers were happy to use more sheets of a lower-priced paper towel,\nwhen needed, rather than spend more money for a premium brand that\nenabled the use of fewer sheets each time. It was a trade-off that made\ngood sense to them.\n\nBounty had captured most of the first consumer segment, but had\nmade few inroads with the other two groups. Pierce wanted to play in all\nthree segments to achieve more scale and enhance profitability. Going\nforward, Bounty would become not one but three distinct products---\neach one designed to target a specific consumer segment. Traditional\nBounty would remain unchanged and serve the first segment, which\nalready loved the brand. A new product called Bounty Extra Soft would\ntarget the consumers who craved a soft, cloth-like feel. And then there\nwas\nfinal segment---the strength-and-price segment. These\nconsumers presented something of a challenge.\n\nthe\n\nMost of the lower-priced paper towels on the market were of poor\nquality, and the Bounty team didn’t want to devalue the core brand by\nassociating it with a subpar product. “Those products fail miserably on\nstrength,” Pierce notes. “They shred, they tear. They disintegrate in the\nface of a spill. Then, you not only have to deal with the spill, but you\nalso have the mess of the towel residue to deal with.” To have the\nBounty name---even at a value price point---a product would have to live\nup to the equity of the Bounty brand. The new offering for the strengthand-price segment was designed not as a stripped-down version of\nBounty, but as a new product with specific consumer needs in mind.\nBounty Basic was considerably stronger than any other value brand and\npriced at about 75 percent of the cost of regular Bounty. Shelved away\nfrom traditional Bounty, with the other lower-priced brands, it spoke\ndirectly to the third segment of consumers.\n\nWhile there was some concern that existing Bounty consumers might\ntrade down to Bounty Basic, the relative attributes of the three products\nfit each segment’s needs so perfectly that little shifting actually occurred.\nPierce notes, “The old Bounty was one product that existed for decades.\nThe modern-day Bounty is now three products that were designed", "source_file": "Playing_to_Win__How_Strategy_Really_Works_-_AG_Lafley.pdf", "extraction_method": "pdfminer", "ocr_used": false, "has_table": false, "chapter_num": null, "chapter_title": null, "section_num": null, "section_title": null}

By staying in the noncommodity space, in\nterms of both product assortment and price point, P&G can target its core\nconsumers through its most valued core retailers (its best and biggest\ncustomers), levering core advantages in innovation and brand building.\nPierce and his team made where-to-play choices on geography (North\nAmerica), consumers (three segments in the top half of the market),\nproducts (paper towels, branded basic and premium), channels (grocery\nstores, mass discounters, drugstores, and membership club stores like\nCostco), and stages of production (R&D and production of the paper\ntowel itself, but not growing, harvesting, or pulping the trees). Making\nthese clear where-to-play choices, for Bounty and the family-care\ncategory, spurred innovation and helped powerful brands grow even\nstronger. As a result, P&G family care consistently delivered business\ngrowth and value creation at industry-leading levels.\n\nThe Importance of the Right Playing Field\n\nThe choice of where to play defines the playing field for the company (or\nbrand, or category, etc.). It is a question of what business you are really\nin. It is a choice about where to compete and where not to compete.\nUnderstanding this choice is crucial, because the playing field you\nchoose is also the place where you will need to find ways to win. Whereto-play choices occur across a number of domains, notably these:\n\nGeography. In what countries or regions will you seek to\ncompete?\n\nProduct type. What kinds of products and services will you offer?\n\nConsumer segment. What groups of consumers will you target? In\nwhich price tier? Meeting which consumer needs?\n\nDistribution channel. How will you reach your customers? What\nchannels will you use?", "source_file": "Playing_to_Win__How_Strategy_Really_Works_-_AG_Lafley.pdf", "extraction_method": "pdfminer", "ocr_used": false, "has_table": false, "chapter_num": null, "chapter_title": null, "section_num": null, "section_title": null}
{"segment_id": "00082", "page_num": 82, "segment": "Vertical stage of production. In what stages of production will you\nengage? Where along the value chain? How broadly or narrowly?\n\nMany individual considerations need to go into the comprehensive\nwhere-to-play choice. And the considerations are the same, no matter the\nsize of the company or type of industry. Think of a small farmer. He\nmust answer a number of questions to get a clear sense of his playing\nfield. Will he sell only locally or to his friends and neighbors, or will he\nattempt to join a co-op that has a larger geographic footprint? Which\nfruits and vegetables will he grow? Will he sell organic products or\nstandard ones? Will he sell bushels of fruit unprocessed or process apples\ninto juice before selling them? Will he sell direct to consumers, or\nthrough a warehouse middleman? If he does process the fruit into juice,\nwill he do that himself or outsource that phase of production? If he is\nthoughtful, the farmer will consider where to play in a manner that\nenables him to choose geographies, segments, products, channels, and\nproduction options that work well together (e.g., selling organic veggies\nlocally at farmer’s markets or processing fruit to sell nationally while\nminimizing spoilage).\n\nStart-ups, small businesses, regional or national companies, and even\nhuge multinationals all face an analogous set of where-to-play choices.\nThe answers, of course, differ. Small businesses may well have narrower\nwhere-to-play choices than larger companies do, largely as a function of\ncapacity and scale. But even the largest companies must make explicit\nchoices to compete in some places, with some products, for some\ncustomers (and not in others). A choice to serve everyone, everywhere---\nor to simply serve all comers---is a losing choice.\n\nChoosing where to play is also about choosing where not to play. This\nis more straightforward when you are considering where to expand (or\nnot), but considerably harder when considering if you should stay in the\nplaces and segments you currently serve. The status quo---continuing on\nin the locations and segments you’ve always been---is all too often an\nimplicit, unexamined choice. Simply because you have made a given\nwhere-to-play choice in the past is not a reason to stay there. Consider a\ncompany like General Electric. A decade ago, it derived considerable\nrevenue from its entertainment holdings (NBC and Universal) and\nmaterials businesses (plastic and silicon).

This was an explicit choice about where not to\nplay.\n\nInevitably, the significance of each dimension of the where-to-play\nchoice will vary by context. Each dimension must be considered\nthoughtfully and will hold different weight in different situations. A\nstart-up might focus first on the products or services to be offered. A\nstagnating giant might focus on customers---looking for a deeper\nunderstanding of needs and new ways to approach segmentation---to\nnarrow and refine an overly broad where-to-play choice.\n\nAt P&G, where to play choices start with the consumer: Who is she?\nWhat does the consumer want and need? To win with mom, P&G invests\nheavily in truly understanding her---through observation, through home\nvisits, through a significant investment in uncovering unmet and\nunexpressed needs. Only through a concerted effort to understand the\nconsumer, her needs, and the way in which P&G can best serve those\nneeds is it possible to effectively determine where to play---which\nbusinesses to enter or leave, which products to sell, which markets to\nprioritize, and so on. As current CEO Bob McDonald explains, “We\ndon’t give lip service to consumer understanding. We dig deep. We\nimmerse ourselves in people’s day-to-day lives. We work hard to find the\ntensions that we can help resolve. From those tensions come insights that\nlead to big ideas.”2 Those big ideas can be the basis of a powerful whereto-play choice.\n\nThe distribution channel choice also tends to loom large for P&G,\nbecause of the dominant size and market power of the retailers in\nquestion. Tesco has more than 30 percent of the UK market.3 Walmart\nserves some 200 million Americans every week.4 Other players, like\nLoblaw in Canada or Carrefour in Europe, have substantial regional\npresence. For this reason, channel is a particularly crucial where-to-play\nconsideration for the company. Of course, for some industries, there is no\nreal channel consideration (e.g., in service industries that deal directly\nwith the end consumer). Again, context matters---and each company\nmust assess the weight of the different where-to-play choices for itself.\n\nOne final consideration for where to play is the competitive set. Just as\nit does when it defines winning aspirations, a company should make its\nwhere-to-play choices with the competition firmly in mind. Choosing a\nplaying field identical to a strong competitor’s can be a less attractive\nproposition than tacking away to compete in a different way, for different\ncustomers, or in different product lines.

When Liquid Tide was introduced in 1984, P&G\nwas entering the liquid-detergent category against a strong, established\ncompetitor. Even with strong brand equity from its powdered detergent,\nthis wouldn’t be an easy win. Wisk, Unilever’s market-leading liquid\ndetergent, was a powerful, established brand with loyal customers. For\nthe first two or three years, Wisk did not give up a share point against\nLiquid Tide. In Liquid Tide’s first year, Wisk actually gained share.\nClearly, Wisk users weren’t moving to Tide. But P&G didn’t need to\nsteal Wisk users to win in the category, at least not right away. The highprofile launch of Liquid Tide helped expand the overall liquid-detergent\ncategory, and P&G picked up the lion’s share of the expansion. Liquid\nTide created new consumers for liquid detergent, and none of them had a\nloyalty to Wisk. As the category grew, Tide could begin to take share\nfrom smaller players, like Dynamo, which couldn’t compete with P&G’s\nR&D, scale, and brand-building expertise. Only then, having built\ncritical mass, would Liquid Tide need to go after Wisk directly. At that\npoint, the battle was all but won.\n\nFor Liquid Tide, it wasn’t a matter of avoiding a playing field that held\na fierce competitor. It was about expanding the playing field to make\nroom for the two competitors and creating time to gain momentum. In\nthe end, Liquid Tide won and took the market lead decisively.\n\nThree Dangerous Temptations\n\nto channels and customers;\n\nAs we’ve noted, there is a lot to consider when crafting a winning whereto\nto-play choice, from consumers\ncompetition; to local, regional, and global differences. In the face of that\nkind of complexity, your\nto\noversimplification, resignation, even desperation. In particular, you\nshould avoid three pitfalls when thinking about where to play. The first is\nto refuse to choose, attempting to play in every field all at once. The\nsecond is to attempt to buy your way out of an inherited and unattractive\nchoice.

Giving in to any one of these temptations leads to weak\nstrategic choices and, often, to failure.\n\nFailing to Choose\n\nFocus is a crucial winning attribute. Attempting to be all things to all\ncustomers tends to result in underserving everyone. Even the strongest\ncompany or brand will be positioned to serve some customers better than\nothers. If your customer segment is “everyone” or your geographic\nchoice is “everywhere,” you haven’t truly come to grips with the need to\nchoose. But, you may argue, don’t companies like Apple and Toyota\nchoose to serve everyone? No, not really. While they do have very large\ncustomer bases, the companies don’t serve all parts of the world and all\ncustomer segments equally. As late as 2009, Apple derived just 2 percent\nof its revenue from China. That was a choice---about where and when to\nplay. It was a choice based on resources, capabilities, and an\nunderstanding that even Apple can’t be everywhere at once.\n\nP&G, too, can’t serve all markets equally well. With Bounty, it chose\nto target three segments of consumers in the top end of the North\nAmerican paper towel market; it chose not to serve the rest of the world\nor consumers for whom price was the primary decision criteria. For P&G\noverall, in choosing where to play in emerging markets, the focus was on\nregions where it had an established business (like Mexico) and where\nnew markets opened equally to all comers at the same time (e.g., Eastern\nEurope right after the fall of the Berlin Wall and China when Deng\nXiaoping opened the first enterprise zones in Guangzhou City). The\ndecision to focus on a very few emerging markets at a time enabled P&G\nto prioritize resource allocation, cash, and, most importantly, people,\nagainst moving up the learning curve and establishing successful\nbusinesses. Without such an explicit choice, P&G would have wound up\nwith a mix of middling businesses scattered around the world, all starved\nfor the attention and resources needed to become a market leader.\n\nTrying to Buy Your Way Out of an Unattractive Game\n\nCompanies often attempt to move out of an unattractive game and into\nan attractive one through acquisition.

Whether in\naluminum, newsprint, or coal, an acquirer is often seduced by the idea of\naccess to the higher prices and faster growth rates of a downstream\nindustry. Unfortunately, there are two big problems with this kind of\nacquisition. The first is price. It costs a great deal to buy into attractive\nindustries---quite often, acquirers must pay more than the asset could\never be worth to them, which dooms the acquirer in the long run.\nSecond, the strategy and capabilities required in the targeted industry are\noften very different from those in the current industry; it is seriously\ntough sledding to bridge the two approaches and have an advantage in\nboth (in mining bauxite and processing aluminum, for instance). Such\nto be both overly expensive and strategically\nacquisitions\nchallenging.\n\ntend\n\nRather than attempting to acquire your way into a more attractive\nposition, you can set a better goal for your company. The real goal\nshould be to create an internal discipline of strategic thinking that\nenables a more thoughtful approach to the current game, regardless of\nindustry, and connects to possible different futures and opportunities.\n\nAccepting an Existing Choice as Immutable\n\nIt can also be tempting to view a where-to-play choice as a given, as\nhaving been made for you. But a company always has a choice of where\nto play. To return to a favorite example, Apple wasn’t bound entirely by\nits first where-to-play choice---which was desktop computers. Though it\neventually established a comfortable niche in that world, as the desktop\nof choice for creative industries, Apple chose to change its playing field\nto move into the portable communication and entertainment space with\nthe iPod, iTunes, iPhone, and iPad.\n\nIt is tempting to think that you have no choice in where to play,\nbecause it makes for a great excuse for mediocre performance. It is not\neasy to change playing fields, but it is doable and can make all the\ndifference. Sometimes the change is subtle, like a shift in consumer\nfocus within a current industry---as with Olay.

We’ve already\nseen the Olay where-to-play choice and how it changed over time.\nRather than attempting to deliver products to all women, in all age\ncategories, at the lower end of the market, the Olay team chose to\ncompete primarily on a narrower field---women aged thirty-five-plus\nwho were newly concerned with the signs of aging.

As late as the 1980s, Tide had two forms---the\ntraditional washing powder and the liquid version---both geared at\ngetting the visible dirt out of your clothes (“Tide’s in, Dirt’s out”). P&G\nbroadened its where-to-play choice for Tide by moving beyond visible\ndirt. Tide introduced product versions designed to address a whole range\nof cleaning needs---Tide with Bleach, Tide Plus a Touch of Downy, Tide\nPlus Febreze, Tide for Coldwater, Tide Unscented; then, P&G expanded\nthe Tide offering from detergents to other laundry-related products---\ncreating a line of stain-release products, most notably the highly\nsuccessful Tide-to-Go instant stain remover.

In 1995, Chip Bergh was appointed general manager\nfor P&G’s US hard-surface cleaners business. Bergh reflects, with a\nlaugh, “It sounds like a very nonelegant, unsexy business, and that’s\nexactly what it was. It was not a strategic priority in the company. But\ninterestingly, for all of our competitors, it was a core business. We knew\nour CEO never rolled out of bed and thought about this business. But for\nour competitors, every morning when the CEO was getting out of bed, he\nwas worrying about this business.”5 The competitive landscape was\nchallenging. Bergh’s brands included past-their-prime names like Comet,\nSpic ’n Span, and Mr. Clean. It was, Bergh notes, “about a $200 million\nbusiness at the time, and it was in free fall.” At one point in the mid1970s, Comet had enjoyed a 50 percent market share of the category. By\n1995, all of P&G’s brands in this category, combined, had less than 20\npercent of the market.\n\nTimes had changed, and P&G had failed to change with them. There\nwere fewer hard surfaces in homes, as fiberglass (and porous marbles\nand other stones) replaced porcelain. Competitors had introduced less\nabrasive cleansers that resonated with consumers; P&G had not. “It was\nclear we had to do something very, very different,” Bergh notes. “We\nrealized that our products were no longer relevant for the consumer and\nthat we had been out-innovated.”\n\nSo Bergh challenged his team to think about where to play from an\nentirely new perspective that would be grounded in an understanding of\nthe competitive landscape and of P&G’s core capabilities. “I took my\nleadership team off-site for two days,” he says. “The focus was to come\nup with a set of choices that would make a difference on the business.\nThe rallying cry we had around the new choices, and around the new\nstrategy, was to fundamentally change the game of cleaning at home and\nmake cleaning less of a chore.” As ever, the starting point was consumer\nneeds---like quick surface cleaning without muss and fuss, addressing a\nparticular job and doing it better than current offerings.

And it is just as easy to write off an entire industry on the\nbasis of the predominant where-to-play choices made by the competitors\nin that industry. But sometimes, you must dig a bit deeper---to examine\nunexpected where-to-play choices from all sides---to truly understand\nwhat is possible and how an industry can be won with a new place to\nplay. This was the case with fine fragrances at P&G.\n\nThe P&G fine-fragrance business had an inauspicious start. In fact,\nP&G’s entry into the category was accidental. In 1991, the company\nacquired Max Factor to bolster the international reach of its color\ncosmetics business (entered in 1989 with the purchase of Noxell, the\nparent company that owned Cover Girl). Cover Girl was exclusively a\nNorth American brand at the time. Max Factor’s cosmetics business was\nprimarily outside North America and thus was a nice, logical fit. As it\nturned out, Max Factor had a tiny fragrance line---so now, P&G was in\nthe fine-fragrance business too. In 1994, then chairman and CEO, Ed\nArtzt, acted to deepen P&G’s participation in the fine-fragrance business\nwith the purchase of Giorgio of Beverly Hills for $150 million. At the\ntime, most thought it was a strange acquisition---staid, Midwestern P&G\nbuying a chic Rodeo Drive perfumery.\n\nIn many ways, it was an odd mix.

Very little of P&G’s\nthe\nbrand-building expertise appeared\nreputations of these fashion brands were highly volatile. They waxed and\nwaned, and there seemed to be little that the brands could do (and even\nless that P&G could do) about it. Very, very few perfume brands endured\nand grew for decades, as Tide and Crest had done. Fragrances were also\nsold substantially through a channel in which P&G was otherwise not\npresent---department stores and perfumeries. And finally, P&G’s R&D\nlabs couldn’t easily develop streams of innovation of the sort that kept\nBounty and Pantene ahead of their competitors. Fine fragrances felt more\nlike the hope-in-a-bottle business: lots of hype and little real technology.\nThe strategic choices and capabilities for fine fragrances had little in\ncommon with the choices for most other P&G businesses. No surprise,\nthen, that the fragrance business struggled along during the 1990s,\nunderperforming relative to the industry and to P&G’s company\nstandards.\n\nOn the surface at least, fine fragrances looked like an obvious choice\nfor divestiture. The business appeared to have a tenuous fit with the\nbroader P&G. What’s more, it had these complicating features---fashionhouse dependence and tricky distribution. P&G had no road map for\nrunning businesses like this internally, and there wasn’t a good analog on\nthe outside to benchmark against. P&G hadn’t been in the portfolio for\nvery long, especially in its post-Giorgio format, so there wasn’t much of\na track record either. The company came very close to divesting the\nbusiness but instead reframed the thinking.\n\nFine fragrances, however, were important to hang on to, for two\nstrategic reasons. First, a fine-fragrance presence was an important\ncomponent of a credible and competitive beauty business. P&G wanted\nto be a beauty leader, on the strength of hair care (Pantene, Head &\nShoulders) and skin care (Olay). But to be truly credible with the\nindustry and consumers as a beauty player, the company needed a\nposition in cosmetics and fragrances as well. The knowledge transfer\nbetween the different categories is significant, meaning that what you\nlearn in cosmetics and fragrances---through both product R&D and\nconsumer research---has a lot of spillover into hair care and skin care,", "source_file": "Playing_to_Win__How_Strategy_Really_Works_-_AG_Lafley.pdf", "extraction_method": "pdfminer", "ocr_used": false, "has_table": false, "chapter_num": null, "chapter_title": null, "section_num": null, "section_title": null}

In other words, just being in the fragrance business\nmakes you better in beauty categories overall.\n\nIn addition, fragrance is a very important part of the hair-care\nexperience---scent alone can significantly influence consumer product\npreferences. And it isn’t just true in hair care, which leads to the second\nstrategic reason to play in fine fragrances: in many household and other\npersonal-care businesses, there were significant consumer segments that\ncared deeply about the sensory experience. P&G could affect consumer\npurchase intent with the right fragrance. It soon became clear that\nfragrance was an important part of creating delightful consumer\nexperiences and that P&G was the biggest fragrance user in the world.\nThis little fine-fragrance business was important well beyond its existing\nsize; it was crucial to building core capabilities and systems that could\ndifferentiate and create competitive advantage for brands and products\nacross the entire corporation.\n\nSo P&G not only held on to the fine-fragrances business, but also built\nit strategically. P&G turned the industry business model inside out by\nmaking a totally different set of strategic where-to-play and how-to-win\nchoices. Within the fine-fragrances industry, there was a well-established\nway to do business: new fragrances were pushed out of the fashion\nstudios and fragrance houses, down the fashion runway, and into\ndepartment stores at Christmas time. Most new fragrance brands were\nlaunched for holiday shopping and began to decline by the next spring. It\nwas a push-and-churn model. And in most cases, it was secondary to\nanother, primary business: fashion.\n\nBy contrast, P&G started with the consumer, hiring its own internal\nteam of master perfumers to design fragrances against specific consumer\nwants and needs, as well as brand concepts. It partnered with the very\nbest fragrance-house perfumers and designers. Before long, P&G\nbecame the preferred innovation partner in the fine-fragrance space.\nP&G brands are consumer-centric, concept-led, and designed to delight\nconsumers. As it dedicated time and attention to the fine-fragrance\nbusiness, P&G attracted the best agency partners and won numerous\nawards for advertising, marketing, and packaging. It built product\nportfolios that expanded and strengthened its consumer user base. It built\nbrands that became leaders in their segments.\n\nAnother norm for the fragrance industry was to compete most\naggressively within the high-end women’s market.

It used P&G brand-building expertise to assess the\nstrength and value of brands to determine which fashion brands to\nlicense and how much to pay for them. It used an understanding of the\ndiscipline of strategy to match its choices with the choices of the\nlicensors, creating greater value for both. On the innovation front, worldleading expertise with scents enabled P&G to create licensed-brand\nproducts that were uniquely appealing to consumers and that could last\nbeyond a season.

He pulls out a white Kitchen Catcher\nbag to demonstrate, opening the bag and holding it out to his guest.1\n“Take a look at that film,” he says. “See those patterns in there? Those\npatterns allow us to put a lot more stretch into the material.”2 Weedman\nmakes a fist and uses it to stretch a small section of the trash bag to its\nlimit. It stretches past his elbow before it tears. “Because of P&G’s\nexpertise in diapers, we know an awful lot about how to manipulate\nfilm,” he explains. “This uses less plastic than those thick bags, and it\nstretches significantly more.” P&G-invented technology produces a\nplastic bag that is both strong and stretchable, but uses considerably less\nmaterial. It means a better product for consumers, with greater capacity\nand less breakage, at a lower cost for the manufacturer.\n\nBuilding on quilting technology developed for paper towels, the\nForceFlex product marked a significant step forward in trash-bag\ntechnology. It came out of P&G labs along with a sister technology---a\nself-sealing plastic wrap. Imagine that you want to put a leftover piece of\nchicken into the freezer for consumption in a few days.

Nonetheless, Impress was the starting point.\n\nTest-market consumers loved Impress. It shot to a more than 25\npercent share almost immediately, at a 30 percent price premium over\nexisting wraps. It clearly had unique product technology that the\ncompetition didn’t have and that consumers valued. Now, normally at\nP&G, this kind of result leads to cheering, investment in a new brand,\nand a full national launch. But the team involved was cognizant of\ncautionary tales on this front and was reluctant to simply dive in with\nthese new plastic technologies.\n\nIn the early 1980s, P&G scientists had developed a way to incorporate\nthe daily recommended intake of calcium in a single serving of orange\njuice.

For all the women and children out there who had to drink\nmilk just to get their calcium, even if they were lactose intolerant or\ndidn’t actually enjoy guzzling milk, this was a big win. Like Impress\ndecades later, the new orange juice with calcium scored very well in\nconsumer testing. It was launched nationally as Citrus Hill in 1983\nagainst\ntwo formidable competitors---Minute Maid (a Coca-Cola\ndivision) and the then-independent Tropicana (later acquired by PepsiCo,\nInc., to become yet another front in the Coke-Pepsi war).

It turned out that both firms\nwere happy to pay to add an attractive benefit to their existing offerings.\nFast forward two decades: competitively, it was clear that Impress\nwould be going up directly against The Clorox Company’s leading Glad\nbrand and SC Johnson’s Saran Wrap; both were powerful brands with\nwell-established product lines.

One of the most intriguing\nwas from Clorox. Clorox had acquired the Glad brand of wraps and trash\nbags in 1999, when it purchased First Brands, outbidding P&G for the\nproperty at the time. As Larry Peiros, then group vice president at The\nClorox Company (now executive vice president and chief operating\nofficer) explains, “Glad was a challenging acquisition from the very\nbeginning. Our products were pretty much undifferentiated, and raw\nmaterial costs were escalating. Our biggest Glad business, trash bags,\nwas threatened by an aggressive competitor in Hefty and parityperforming store brands. Our food-storage Glad products, Glad Cling\nWrap and GladWare, were under pressure from Ziploc’s leading foodstorage business. The business was struggling, and it was clear we\nneeded very major product development and capital investment to be\nsuccessful over the long term.”3 But Clorox didn’t have the kind of\nproprietary R&D expertise with materials and plastics that P&G did. Nor\ndid it have P&G’s massive scale. Plus, the Clorox team understood the\nimplications if the P&G technology went to a rival company. So, the\nteam came forward with an unusual pitch for a larger partnership.\n\n“There were a lot of reasons why we wanted a deeper relationship than\njust licensing,” Peiros recalls. “Procter is a technology machine. They\ncompete in many multi-billion-dollar categories in which they are\ndeveloping new innovations. Some of those innovations would be\napplicable to bags and wraps.

The\nsecond is how to win. Winning means providing a better consumer and\ncustomer value equation than your competitors do, and providing it on a\nsustainable basis. As Mike Porter first articulated more than three\ndecades ago, there are just two generic ways of doing so: cost leadership\nand differentiation (for more on the microeconomic foundations of these\ntwo strategies, see appendix B).\n\nLow-Cost Strategies\n\nIn cost leadership, as the name suggests, profit is driven by having a\nlower cost structure than competitors do. Imagine that companies A, B,\nand C all produce widgets for which customers will gladly pay $100.\nThe products are comparable, so if one company charges more for its\nproduct than the others do, most customers will elect not to buy it in\nfavor of the less expensive versions. Company B and company C have\ncomparable cost structures and produce the widgets for $60, earning a\n$40 margin. Company A has a lower cost structure for producing\nessentially the same product and is able to do so for $45, producing a\n$55 margin. In this instance, company A is the low-cost leader and has a\ndramatic advantage over its competitors.\n\nThe low-cost player doesn’t necessarily charge the lowest prices.\nLow-cost players have the option of underpricing competitors, but can\nalso reinvest the margin differential in ways that create competitive\nadvantage. Mars is a great example of this approach. Since the 1980s, it\nhas held a distinct cost advantage over Hershey’s in candy bars. Mars has\nchosen to structure its range of candy bars such that they can be\nproduced on a single super-high-speed production line. The company\nalso utilizes less-expensive ingredients (by and large). Both of these\nchoices greatly reduce product cost. Hershey’s and other competitors\nhave multiple methods of production and more-expensive ingredients\nand hence higher cost structures. Rather than selling its bars at a lower\nprice (which is nearly impossible because of the dynamics of the\nconvenience-store trade), Mars has chosen to buy the best shelf space in\nthe candy bar rack in every convenience store in America.

The\ncompany grew from Michael Dell’s dorm-room start-up in 1984 to a\ncompany worth $100 billion at its height in 1999.\n\nWhile all companies make efforts to control costs, there is only one\nlow-cost player in any industry---the competitor with the very lowest\ncosts. Having lower costs than some but not all competitors can enable a\nfirm to stick around and compete for a while. But it won’t win. Only the\ntrue low-cost player can win with a low-cost strategy.\n\nDifferentiation Strategies\n\nto\n\nlow cost\n\nThe alternative\nis differentiation. In a successful\ndifferentiation strategy, the company offers products or services that are\nperceived to be distinctively more valuable to customers than are\ncompetitive offerings, and is able to do so with approximately the same\ncost structure that competitors use. In this case, companies A, B, and C\nproduce widgets and all do so for $60 per widget. But while customers\nare willing to pay $100 for widgets from company A or B, they are\nwilling to pay $115 for company C’s widgets, because of a perception of\ngreater quality or more-interesting designs. Here, company C has a $15\nhigher margin than its competitors and a substantial advantage over\nthem.\n\nIn this type of strategy, different offerings have different consumer\nvalue equations and different prices associated with them.

The more a product is differentiated along a\ndimension consumers care about, the higher price premium it can\ndemand.

While Toyota is sometimes\nconsidered a lost-cost player because of its focus on manufacturing\neffectiveness, it is really a differentiator. Its manufacturing effectiveness\nis necessary to make up for its production environment (which is heavily\nweighted to high-cost Japan). However, the automaker is able to earn a\nprice premium of several thousand dollars per vehicle over its\ncompetitors in the US car market, while producing vehicles at similar\ncost. The best-selling Camry and Corolla models have a reputation for\nsuperior quality, reliability, and durability, driving the significant price\npremium.

In a differentiator, managers are forever attempting to\ndeepen their holistic understanding of customers to learn how to serve\nthem more distinctively.

At a differentiator, customers are jealously\nguarded. If customers indicate a desire for something different, the firm\ntries to design a new offering that the customers will adore. And if a\ncustomer leaves, the departure drives a stake in the heart of the firm,\nindicating a failure of the strategy with that customer. It is as simple as\nthe difference between Southwest Airlines and Apple.

A company with a competitive advantage earns a greater margin\nbetween revenue and cost than other companies do for engaging in the\nsame activity. A firm can use that additional margin to fight those other\ncompanies, which will not have the resources to defend themselves. It\ncan use that advantage to win.

That’s why building up strategic thinking capability\nwithin your organization is so vital.\n\nStrategic capability is required for thinking your way out of difficult\npositions---like the one that faced the Gain laundry detergent team. At\none point, Gain was virtually out of business---with distribution in just a\nfew southern states. In fact, in the late 1980s, the Gain brand manager,\nJohn Lilly, sent a memo to then-CEO John Smale recommending that the\nbrand be discontinued. Smale sent the memo back to Lilly with his full\nresponse written across the top: “John, one more try please.” Smale\ndidn’t dispute the logic of the memo; he just wanted to give Gain another\nchance, even if it was a long shot.\n\nThe Gain team (then led by subsequent brand manager Eleni Senegos)\nset out to redefine the Gain where-to-play and how-to-win choices,\ngiving it one more try. Again, the team started with the consumer. Tide\nwas the overwhelming market leader and largely owned the all-purposecleaning position. But the consumer segmentation data showed that a\nsmall but passionate group of consumers wasn’t well served by Tide or\nby any other competitive product. This segment cared very much about\nthe sensory laundry experience---about the scent of the product in the\nbox, the scent during the washing process, and especially the scent of\nclean clothes. Scent was the proof of clean for these consumers. At the\ntime, there wasn’t a brand positioned for scent seekers, people who want\na dramatic and powerful fragrance experience from the moment the box\nis opened through the entire wash process, out of the dryer, and into the\ndrawer. Gain could fill that niche.\n\nMoving Gain into the scent-seeker position was possible through\nP&G’s expertise with fragrance across product categories. P&G, as\nwe’ve noted, is the largest fragrance company in the world; not only\ndoes it have a robust business in fine fragrances, but virtually every P&G\nproduct has a distinctive fragrance, geared to create a unique and\ndesirable user experience.

The Gain team plugged away at that\npositioning on the shelf and in advertising. Gain is now one of P&G’s\nbillion-dollar brands, even though it is only sold in the United States and\nCanada. And the impetus was Smale’s push to think again, to find a new\nway to win.\n\nThe Febreze strategy offers another example of finding a way to win.\nP&G had struggled to reinvigorate its home-care business and grow the\ncategory overall. The company once held a strong position in surface\ncleaners, with brands like Comet and Spic ’n Span, but had made a\nwhere-to-play choice to divest those brands and refocus the home-care\nteam on new consumer and product segments and new product\ntechnologies, building these organically rather than through acquisition.\nOne of those new products, based on a proprietary technology, was a\nspray that could remove odors from soft surfaces. It wasn’t a totally new\nproduct, but really a better air freshener---one that could actually remove\nodors rather than covering them up.\n\nUnfortunately, the air-freshener segment had two large incumbent\nplayers in Reckitt-Benckiser (maker of Air Wick) and SC Johnson\n(Glade). This was a core strategic category for both companies; they\nweren’t willing to sell their established brands to P&G and it was a\ncategory they would likely defend at all costs against a new entrant. So,\nin terms of how to win, the question was how best to introduce this new\ntechnology in a way that would prove its effectiveness to consumers,\nbuild a strong, differentiated brand, and avoid the competitive walled\ncities in air-freshening and deodorizing at the outset.\n\nUltimately, Febreze was a product technology in search of a job to be\ndone. To have the best chance to win, the home-care team elected to start\nin P&G’s home court, with laundry---positioning the new technology as\na laundry additive that would attack odors. The team then attacked\nsequentially along the lines of least to more resistance: as a refresher for\ncurtains, carpets, and upholstery around the home; as a deodorizer for\nother malodorous objects around the home, like running shoes and sports\nequipment; and finally as an air deodorizer and freshener. Along the way,\nP&G acquired AmbiPur from Sara Lee to expand the superior Febreze\ntechnology faster into Europe and certain emerging markets.

The team\nfound new ways to win by creating brands based on specific consumer\nneeds and wants, partnering in distinctively successful ways with\nfragrance houses and designers. In doing so, the fine-fragrance business\nbecame part of P&G’s larger how-to-win strategy, another way to\ndifferentiate brands along a dimension that consumers care about and to\nleverage the benefits of global scale.\n\nIt is tempting to believe that strategy in general, and where-to-play and\nhow-to-win choices in particular, are needed only for outward-facing\nfunctions---those folks who interact with external consumers and\ncompetitors. But every line of business and function should have a\nstrategy---one that aligns with the strategy of the company overall and\ndecides where to play and how to win specifically for its context. At\nP&G, corporate functions are all tasked with crafting their own strategies\nin this way. Joan Lewis, global consumer market knowledge officer,\nexplains: “Where to play and how to win has been a very important\nframework for us. Organizations are often good at one or the other\nwithout realizing that they’re two different sets of decisions. At one\npoint, we weren’t as disciplined about our where-to-play choices. It was\neverywhere anybody needed consumer insight or anywhere we thought it\ncould add value. Just like a business dilutes its focus and in turn its\ngrowth potential when you try to do too many things at a time or do\nthings that are further away from your core strengths, we were relatively\ndiluted in the nature of the impact we could have.”4\n\nSo, Lewis and her team worked to think more critically about their\nstrategy, considering “what kinds of company decisions or individual\nbusiness decisions we are aiming to influence: those where consumer\nunderstanding is a key driver for company success. We made a clear\nwhere-to-play commitment to the company.

Instead,\nbecause consumer insights are so crucial to its how-to-win choices as a\ncompany, P&G kept the intellectual capital in-house, where Lewis’s\ngroup designs new and customized test methods to suit specific needs,\nand outsources industry-standard research, like surveys and focus\ngroups. Lewis and her team determine what winning looks like for their\nfunction, keeping their internal customers and the full marketplace in\nmind. This approach enables them to make smarter day-to-day decisions\non the basis of an overriding strategy and to build the strongest\nconsumer-insights capability in the industry.\n\nThe best-of-breed outsourcing strategy for P&G’s GBS demonstrates\nthe power of thinking through where to play and how to win for an\ninternal function. The best-of-breed approach was a thoughtful choice---\nfor each service, the company selected the provider that could best create\njoint value with P&G, while freeing up the core GBS team to focus on\nbuilding decisive P&G capabilities. This foundational how-to-win choice\nhas led the team to continue to focus on how to win with its internal\ncustomers---driving costs of the system, outsourcing noncore activities,\nand building systems to support P&G’s company, business-unit, and\nfunctional strategic choices.\n\nReinforcing Choices\n\nWhere-to-play and how-to-win choices do not function independently; a\nstrong where-to-play choice is only valuable if it is supported by a robust\nand actionable how-to-win choice.

Instead, the company found a how-to-win\nchoice, a joint venture with a competitor, and the venture created new\nvalue for consumers and for both P&G and Clorox. The where and how\nwere considered together, and a very different approach was created.\n\nThe P&G diaper business in emerging markets provides another\nexample. By 2000, the company was making good progress on\nexpanding into emerging markets across a number of categories. The\nbaby-care business had a global strategy that included regaining brand\nclarity in North America, reasserting market leadership in Europe, and\nextending beyond diapers into other kinds of baby-care products.\nLaunching into emerging markets was one part of this larger strategy.\nThe decision was made to start with Asia, because of its attractive\ndemographics. But what kind of a how-to-win choice would work well\nwith that where-to-play choice? How could P&G not only enter the\nAsian baby-care market, but also win there? And how would the\nemerging-market strategy fit into the global baby-care strategy?\n\nIt would be a challenge. The Pampers diapers that were sold globally\nwere simply too expensive to be sold in emerging markets. Traditionally,\nconsumer goods companies have taken one of two approaches in such a\nsituation. One is the trickle-down technology approach, basically taking\na once cutting-edge but now largely obsolete product from the developed\nworld and selling it in emerging markets. The other common approach is\nto take the existing premium product and strip out as many costs as\npossible. Essentially, explains Deb Henretta, then group president for\nAsia and global specialty (now group president of global skin care,\nbeauty, and personal care), “we would take a diaper that at the time in\nNorth America or Western Europe was costing about $0.24 a diaper and\nwhittle it down, slicing the salami thinner and thinner and thinner to get\nto something that was in the $0.08 to $0.10 range.”5 Usually, the\nresulting product was deficient, a pale imitation that met no one’s needs.\nInstead of trying either of these routes, Henretta and her team took a\ndifferent approach: “Let’s go to a white sheet of paper,” she told her\nteam, “keeping the consumer in mind. Let’s find out what those\nconsumers actually need and build that diaper. You only build what they\nneed; you don’t build all the bells and whistles that only consumers in\ndeveloped markets expect.”", "source_file": "Playing_to_Win__How_Strategy_Really_Works_-_AG_Lafley.pdf", "extraction_method": "pdfminer", "ocr_used": false, "has_table": false, "chapter_num": null, "chapter_title": null, "section_num": null, "section_title": null}

All that came\ntogether as the proposition.”\n\nThe new, blank-sheet-of-paper approach required a different way of\nthinking about innovation capability. Traditionally, in diapers and\nelsewhere, the emphasis had been on cutting-edge technology. Here, the\nR&D teams had a different challenge---to address the specific,\ndifferentiated needs of consumers in emerging markets within specific\ncost parameters. It was a different way of thinking about and using the\ncore innovation capability---but one on which the R&D teams were able\nto deliver. The result was market leadership in China in a rapidly\ngrowing category.\n\nSumming Up\n\nIn choosing where to play, you must consider a series of important\ndimensions, like geographies, products, consumer needs, and so on, to\nfind a smart playing field. How-to-win choices determine what you will\ndo on that playing field. Because contexts, like competitive dynamics\nand company capabilities, differ greatly, there is no single, simple\ntaxonomy of how-to-win choices. At a high level, the choice is whether\nto be the low-cost player or a differentiator. But the how of each strategy\nwill differ by context. Cost leaders can create advantage at many\ndifferent points---sourcing, design, production, distribution, and so on.\nDifferentiators can create a strong price premium on brand, on quality,\non a particular kind of service, and so forth. Remember that there is no\none single how-to-win choice for all companies. Even in a single market,\nit is possible to compete in many different ways and succeed. Choosing a\nhow-to-win approach is a matter of thinking both broadly and deeply, in\nthe context of the playing fields available to the company.\n\nAction consistent with the how-to-win choice is vital. Cost leadership\nand differentiation have different imperatives that should lead to\ndifferent sets of activities within a firm.

Lafley\n\nBack in the late 1950s, a P&G chemist named Vic Mills had a profound dislike for\ncleaning his grandson’s cloth diapers; he was convinced there had to be a better\nway and began studying the nascent disposable-diaper product segment, which\nthen represented less than 1 percent of the billions of diaper changes in the\nUnited States every year.\n\nAfter studying first-generation disposable baby diapers from around the world,\nand after several designs failed in premarket consumer tests, P&G tested a threelayer, rectangular pad design (a plastic back sheet, absorbent wadding material,\nand water-repellent top sheet) in Peoria, Illinois, in December 1961. It failed too.\nMothers liked the disposable diaper product, but the $0.10-per-diaper price was\ntoo high. After another six market tests, further refinements in design and\nengineering, and the development of an entirely new manufacturing process,\nP&G finally had a success---this time at $0.06 a diaper.\n\nThe company launched the new diaper as Pampers.a Throughout the rest of\nthe 1960s and the 1970s, Pampers built significant unit volume and dollar sales\nby converting cloth-diaper users to disposables users. P&G effectively created a\nnew category and easily won a leading share in it. Looking back, the Pampers\nstory is a great example of strategic insight and vision.

Lafley\n\nBack in the late 1950s, a P&G chemist named Vic Mills had a profound dislike for\ncleaning his grandson’s cloth diapers; he was convinced there had to be a better\nway and began studying the nascent disposable-diaper product segment, which\nthen represented less than 1 percent of the billions of diaper changes in the\nUnited States every year.\n\nAfter studying first-generation disposable baby diapers from around the world,\nand after several designs failed in premarket consumer tests, P&G tested a threelayer, rectangular pad design (a plastic back sheet, absorbent wadding material,\nand water-repellent top sheet) in Peoria, Illinois, in December 1961. It failed too.\nMothers liked the disposable diaper product, but the $0.10-per-diaper price was\ntoo high. After another six market tests, further refinements in design and\nengineering, and the development of an entirely new manufacturing process,\nP&G finally had a success---this time at $0.06 a diaper.\n\nThe company launched the new diaper as Pampers.a Throughout the rest of\nthe 1960s and the 1970s, Pampers built significant unit volume and dollar sales\nby converting cloth-diaper users to disposables users. P&G effectively created a\nnew category and easily won a leading share in it. Looking back, the Pampers\nstory is a great example of strategic insight and vision.

The bigger the deal, the\nless likely it seems to produce success. There are many cautionary tales,\nincluding AOL Time Warner, DaimlerChrysler, Sprint-Nextel, and\nQuaker-Snapple. In each\nto\nmaterialize, value was destroyed rather than created, and shares\nplummeted. In the case of Snapple, Quaker paid $1.7 billion for the\nbrand in 1995, promising to turn it into the next Gatorade. Less than\nthree years later, Quaker unloaded a much-diminished Snapple for just\n$300 million. Time Warner valued AOL at approximately $190 billion at\nthe time of their merger and just ten years later spun it off for a mere $3\nbillion.1\n\ninstance, promised synergies failed\n\nSo how did P&G’s 2005 acquisition of Gillette manage to buck the\ntrend? The merger was no simpler. In fact, it was relatively complex, as\nthe Sunday Times of London explains: “$11 billion of Gillette sales\ncombined with $57 billion of P&G business, 30,000 employees\ncombining with 100,000 at P&G, on the ground in 80 countries, selling\nin 160.”2 Yet, the acquisition delivered over $2 billion in cost synergies\nin two years and continues to deliver significant revenue synergies after\nintegration. Gillette was P&G’s biggest value-creating acquisition by a\nwide margin, comfortably exceeding the value creation promised to\nshareholders.\n\nThe roots of the acquisition’s success go back to the initial\nconsideration of the opportunity. As Clayt Daley, who retired as chief\nfinancial officer in 2009, explains, P&G had three relevant criteria for\nany acquisition. First, any acquisition had to be “growth accretive---in a\nmarket that was growing (and likely to continue growing) faster than the", "source_file": "Playing_to_Win__How_Strategy_Really_Works_-_AG_Lafley.pdf", "extraction_method": "pdfminer", "ocr_used": false, "has_table": false, "chapter_num": null, "chapter_title": null, "section_num": null, "section_title": null}

Second, the\nacquisition had to be structurally attractive---a business “that tended to\nhave gross and operating margins above the industry or company\naverage. We were looking for businesses that could generate strong, free\ncash flow.” Free cash flow was an important driver of value creation for\nP&G corporately. Once those two hurdles were cleared, there was a final\ncriterion---one that too few companies consider systematically: how the\npotential acquisition would fit with the company’s strategy---its winning\naspiration, its choices about where to play and how to win, its\ncapabilities, and its management systems.\n\nGillette had powerful brands (like Mach 3, Venus, and Oral B) that\nwould importantly add to the P&G beauty and personal-care businesses.\nAnd it contributed significant cash flow. But, as Daley explains, “then\nyou get into ‘what did P&G bring to the party? How good of a fit are\nthey with our sources of competitive advantage?’” The fit was quite\ngood: in terms of where to play, Gillette provided the leading male and\nfemale shaving brands and the leading toothbrush business in the world,\nall large enough to instantly become core businesses for P&G. Gillette\nalso fit well with the strategic choice to grow in the beauty-care and\npersonal-care categories. Plus, geographically, it offered complementary\nstrengths in emerging markets, providing leadership positions in\ncountries where P&G was building presence (like Brazil, India, and\nRussia). On how to win, Gillette’s brand-building expertise, product\ninnovation, core technologies, and retail merchandising mastery aligned\nwell with P&G’s company-level choices.\n\nBut there was still more to consider. “At the end of the day,” Daley\ncontinues, “it really comes down to, are you, as an acquirer, going to\nbring value to that acquisition or not? The acquisition is only really\nsuccessful if you’re a better owner of the business than either the\nprevious owner or the company as an independent company. That\nusually gets down to your capabilities, in our case, your consumer\ncapabilities, your branding capabilities, your R&D capabilities, your goto-market capabilities, your global infrastructure, your back office.

Bergh\nrecalls, “Unlike a lot of acquisitions, it wasn’t a successful company\nbuying an unsuccessful company. It was a successful company buying a\nsuccessful company.”4 Bergh was the first P&G person on the ground at\nGillette, heading to Boston just ten days after the deal closed. “A big part\nof my job initially was helping Gillette plug into P&G, connecting the\npipes, making sure that everything was working, keeping the business\ngoing, and working with the Gillette CEO, Jim Kilts, and the leadership\nteam, while also learning their business from them.”\n\nNine months later, Bergh officially took over the blades and razors\nbusiness. First, “we went to work on Gillette’s male grooming strategy,”\nhe recalls. “There was a lot to love about the business, but I felt that\nthere was a lot of opportunity too. I wanted to use an off-site with the\nleadership team to send a signal that we’ve got to protect all of the great\nthings that have worked, but then start really bringing to the party some\nof P&G’s core capabilities. We were looking for ways that we could\naccelerate growth on this very profitable and attractive business.” It was\na matter of leveraging Gillette and P&G capabilities and selectively\ncreating new ones where capabilities did not exist at the level required to\nwin.\n\nAs discussed earlier, the five capabilities core to P&G’s where-to-play\nand how-to-win choices are consumer understanding, brand building,\ninnovation, go-to-market ability, and global scale. The notion of bringing\nthese capabilities to bear on the Gillette business was top of mind. From\nthe first meeting post-acquisition, Bergh set out to incorporate P&G’s\nstrategy framework into the Gillette DNA, working to articulate\nGillette’s choice cascade. Once the where-to-play and how-to-win\nchoices were clear, the team could turn its attention to the capabilities\nrequired to deliver on those choices.\n\nSoon an explicit where-to-play and how-to-win strategy for Gillette as\npart of P&G emerged. The first choice was to get back into a clear-cut\nwinning position with male shaving systems, leveraging Gillette Fusion,\na top-end product about to be launched.

Third was to win in women’s hair removal too,\nacross wet shaving, epilators, and depilatories. The fourth strategic\npriority for Gillette was to stimulate consumption by expanding into\nemerging markets in general and to India in particular.\n\nGillette would need specific capabilities to deliver on these choices.\nAs with diapers, a where-to-play choice that included the developing\nworld demanded a thoughtful how-to-win choice suitable for that\ncontext. Gillette needed a razor that would uniquely meet the needs of\nconsumers in the developing world. To get there, the team would have to\nbring P&G’s deep consumer understanding and world-leading innovation\ninto play.\n\nP&G’s deep-dive ethnographic approach to consumer research (which\nrelies on in-store and in-home observation and qualitative assessments)\nwas largely new to Gillette, which had relied much more heavily on\nstandard quantitative research. Bergh encouraged his team to think\ndifferently about the emerging-market consumer. He recalls a meeting in\nBoston that launched Gillette’s first-ever design-from-scratch innovation\nfor emerging markets, with a focus, in this case, on India. The group\nincluded, he says, “scientists from the Reading Technical Centre in the\nUK, our upstream innovation lab outside of London, scientists from\nBoston, marketing people, and market-research people, all together for a\nthree-day session to start mapping out the work.”\n\nBergh’s direction to the team was simple: “The first thing I want you\nto do is to spend two weeks in India. I want you to live with these\nconsumers. I want you to go into their homes. You need to understand\nhow they shave and how shaving fits into their lives.” One of Gillette’s\nsenior scientists, a research fellow from the Reading lab, was, according\nto Bergh, both highly respected and conceptually brilliant. Bergh says\nthe scientist wasn’t convinced: “He raised his hand, kind of sheepishly,\nand said, ‘Chip, why do we have to go to India? We have a lot of Indian\nmen who live right outside of our door in Reading. Why can’t we just\nrecruit them?’”\n\nWhy indeed? Yet Bergh was convinced that going to India was the\nright things to do. His experiences told him it would be necessary to\nengage with real Indian consumers on the ground in the actual Indian\nmarket. So he sent the team to India. He was gratified by the result: the\nsame scientist sought him out a few months later during an innovation\nreview.

Now I really understand the company’s statement\nof purpose about improving consumers’ lives ... I was so motivated and\nso inspired, I designed the first razor on a napkin flying back to\nLondon.” The man, Bergh says, had tears in his eyes as he told the story.\nOnly in India did the scientist really begin to understand the needs of\nthe Indian consumer. He learned what he could not learn inside his lab or\nfrom consumer testing outside London. Typically, razors are designed\nand tested with the assumption that everyone shaves as people do in the\nWest, with reliable access to a large sink and running hot water. In India,\nthe team members saw that this simply wasn’t true. Many of the men\nthey met shaved with only a small cup of cold water. Without hot\nrunning water to clean the razor, small hairs tend to clog the blade,\nmaking shaving far more difficult. Gillette’s new product would take that\nunique challenge into account. It would be a new kind of razor, custombuilt to meet the needs of consumers in India. The Gillette Guard razor,\nas it came to be called (and which bore a close resemblance to the one\nfirst sketched on that napkin), has a single-blade system with a safety\ncomb designed to prevent nicks and an easy-rinse cartridge.5 The razor\ncosts 15 rupees, or $0.34, and uses blades that cost 5 rupees, or $0.11, to\nreplace.6 By contrast, the top-end Gillette Fusion Pro-Glide is sold for\n$10.99 in the United States, with replacement blade cartridges at about\n$3 each.7 Within three months, the Guard was the best-selling razor in\nIndia, winning through a set of capabilities in innovation and consumer\nunderstanding that had to be cultivated, rather than left to chance. By\nengaging directly with the Indian consumer, by treating that consumer as\nthe boss, the Gillette team was able to understand what he values and\nwhat he experiences.\n\nFor chief information officer Passerini, the capabilities required to make\nthe Gillette acquisition a success looked a little different. For him and his\nteam, the whole undertaking was in large part a systems-integration\nchallenge. They had to integrate two massive businesses, with two very\ndifferent IT systems, without missing a beat. “We integrated Gillette in\nfifteen months,” he says, with just a hint of pride in his voice. “That was\nworth $4 million per day, doing it in fifteen months instead of doing it in\nthe usual three to four years.”8 The accomplishment required that", "source_file": "Playing_to_Win__How_Strategy_Really_Works_-_AG_Lafley.pdf", "extraction_method": "pdfminer", "ocr_used": false, "has_table": false, "chapter_num": null, "chapter_title": null, "section_num": null, "section_title": null}

They are best understood as\noperating as a system of reinforcing activities---a concept first articulated\nby Harvard Business School’s Michael Porter. Porter noted that powerful\nand sustainable competitive advantage is unlikely to arise from any one\ncapability (e.g., having the best sales force in the industry or the best\ntechnology in the industry), but rather from a set of capabilities that both", "source_file": "Playing_to_Win__How_Strategy_Really_Works_-_AG_Lafley.pdf", "extraction_method": "pdfminer", "ocr_used": false, "has_table": false, "chapter_num": null, "chapter_title": null, "section_num": null, "section_title": null}

Since “competitive strategy is\nabout being different ... [and] means deliberately choosing a different set\nof activities to deliver unique value,” an activity system must also be\ndistinctive from the activity systems of competitors.10 In his landmark\n1996 article “What Is Strategy?,” Porter illustrated his theory with\nexamples from Southwest Airlines, Progressive Insurance, and The\nVanguard Group, articulating the way in which each organization made\ndistinctive choices and tailored an activity system to deliver on those\nchoices.\n\nThe activity system is a visual representation of the firm’s competitive\nadvantage, capturing on a single page the core capabilities of the firm.11\nArticulating a firm’s core capabilities is a vital step in the strategy\nprocess. Identifying the capabilities required to deliver on the where-toplay and how-to-win choices crystallizes the area of focus and\ninvestment for the company. It enables a firm to continue to invest in its\ncurrent capabilities, to build up others, and to reduce the investment in\ncapabilities that are not essential to the strategy.\n\nIn 2000, P&G’s where-to-play choices were coming together (i.e.,\ngrow from the core; extend into home, beauty, health, and personal care;\nand expand into emerging markets), and its how-to-win choices were\nalso becoming clear (i.e., excellence in consumer-focused brand\nbuilding; innovative product design; and leveraging global scale and\nretailer partnerships). These choices needed to be translated into the set\nof capabilities required to deliver.\n\nThe thinking process was kicked off at an off-site meeting for business\nand functional leaders. Leaders were placed into teams by business and\nby function and then asked to capture what they thought were the key\nstrengths of the company. After a long day of discussion and debate, the\nteams had generated more than a hundred potential competitive strengths\non charts around the room. As might have been predicted, every function\nhad\nits unique set of disciplinary capabilities and\ncompetencies.

The next morning, everyone\nwould be given three votes on what constituted the core capabilities of\nthe company, along the following criteria: first, for a given capability, the\ngroup had to be reasonably sure P&G already had real, measurable\ncompetitive advantage in that area and could widen its margin of\nadvantage in the future. Second, the capability had to be broadly relevant\nand important to the majority of P&G’s businesses. That is, it had to be a\ncompany-level rather than business-level capability that distinguished\nP&G from its competitors. Third, the capability had to be decisive, a real\ncompetitive advantage that was the difference between winning and\nlosing. Ultimately, the question was, what capabilities must P&G, as a\nglobal company, have to win across the industries in which it would\ncompete?\n\nWith capabilities, again, winning is an essential criterion. Companies\ncan be good at a lot of things. But there are a smaller number of activities\nthat together create distinctiveness, underpinning specific where-to-play\nand how-to-win choices. P&G certainly needs\nto be good at\nmanufacturing, but not distinctively good at it to win. On the other hand,\nP&G does need to be distinctively good at understanding consumers, at\ninnovation, and at branding its products. When articulating core\ncapabilities, you need to distinguish between generic strengths and\ncritical, mutually reinforcing activities. A company needs to invest\ndisproportionately in building the core capabilities that together produce\ncompetitive advantage.\n\nWhen thinking about capabilities, you may be tempted to simply ask\nwhat you are really good at and attempt to build a strategy from there.\nThe danger of doing so is that the things you’re currently good at may\nactually be irrelevant to consumers and in no way confer a competitive\nadvantage. Rather than starting with capabilities and looking for ways to\nwin with those capabilities, you need to start with setting aspirations and\ndetermining where to play and how to win. Then, you can consider\ncapabilities in light of those choices.

At the same time,\nMDOs have responsibility for a continent, region, country, channel, or\ncustomer, paying close attention to its specific needs and demands.

As Porter notes, not all of the elements need to be\nunique or impossible to replicate. It is the combination of capabilities, the\nactivity system in its entirety, that must be inimitable.\n\nWhen it has a feasible and distinctive activity system, you can ask, is the\nsystem defensible against competitive action?

Measuring the P&G activity\nsystem against these criteria, it fairs well. Time has demonstrated that it was\nfeasible to build: some capabilities, such as Connect + Develop (P&G’s\nversion of open innovation), design, globally distributed R&D, and the\nglobal business services organization, had to be built, so P&G invested in\nthem.

In the case of Head & Shoulders,\nfor instance, one level down from brand would be individual product\n(Head & Shoulders Classic Clean, Head & Shoulders Extra Volume, and\nso on). If you were to build the activity system for each of these products\nand compare it with the brand system, there would be little difference.\nEach product represents a small variation in formulation. But going up a\nlevel from brand to the hair-care category, the activity systems would be\nquite different.

This\nindivisible level will not be the same in every organization (i.e., the\nindivisible activity system is not always found at the brand level). Every\ncompany has to find the level of direct competition and begin\narticulating capabilities there.

First, it can provide the benefit of a shared activity.\nFor example, the hair-care category can have a research laboratory that\ndoes fundamental research on cleaning, conditioning, and styling, which,\nbecause of its massive scale across all the hair brands, performs at a\nfraction of the cost that it would take for Head & Shoulders to do on its\nown. The technology advantage that is enabled through shared activities\ncan be powerful. The second way a higher level of aggregation can\nprovide value is through skills and knowledge transfer.

However, you can use three\nprinciples to help the company put together integrated activity systems at\nmultiple organizational levels.\n\n1. Start at the Indivisible Level\n\nWhen building an activity system, you will know that you are in the right\nspot if the following conditions hold true: (1) the activity system would\nlook more or less the same down one level, but (2) it looks meaningfully\ndifferent up one organizational level. In the case of Head & Shoulders,\nfor instance, one level down from brand would be individual product\n(Head & Shoulders Classic Clean, Head & Shoulders Extra Volume, and\nso on). If you were to build the activity system for each of these products\nand compare it with the brand system, there would be little difference.\nEach product represents a small variation in formulation. But going up a\nlevel from brand to the hair-care category, the activity systems would be\nquite different. At the hair-care category level, the portfolio includes\nproducts such as Nice ’n Easy hair colorants, Herbal Essences hair gels,\nand so on. The Head & Shoulders map is geared to produce advantage\nvia innovation in therapeutic ingredients, while the Nice ’n Easy map\nprominently features implements, dispensers, and color research. The\nhair-care category activity system would need to be a more general\nsystem that captures the essence of those below it and connects to those\nabove.\n\nThe ground-level maps (e.g., Head & Shoulders and Nice ’n Easy) can\nbe thought of as indivisible activity systems: below this level, the activity\nsystem doesn’t divide into distinct maps, while above this level, multiple\ndistinct maps are aggregated together into a unique system. This\nindivisible level will not be the same in every organization (i.e., the\nindivisible activity system is not always found at the brand level). Every\ncompany has to find the level of direct competition and begin\narticulating capabilities there. Build activity systems starting at the\nground level---the point of indivisible activity systems---and work your\nway up from there. Why? The capabilities at the indivisible level drive\nthe ones above.\n\n2.

Since aggregation\ninevitably creates costs (financial and administrative) that wouldn’t exist\nif the indivisible activity systems existed as separate businesses, the\nstrategy at all levels of aggregation must contribute a countervailing\nbenefit to those below, somehow improving their competitiveness.\n\nA level can contribute a net benefit in two ways---through two kinds\nof reinforcing rods. First, it can provide the benefit of a shared activity.\nFor example, the hair-care category can have a research laboratory that\ndoes fundamental research on cleaning, conditioning, and styling, which,\nbecause of its massive scale across all the hair brands, performs at a\nfraction of the cost that it would take for Head & Shoulders to do on its\nown. The technology advantage that is enabled through shared activities\ncan be powerful. The second way a higher level of aggregation can\nprovide value is through skills and knowledge transfer. For example, if\nHead & Shoulders needs well-trained brand managers and R&D\nmanagers to work in its business, and those can be provided by the haircare category, then this represents a valuable transfer of skills to Head &\nShoulders.\n\nManagement at the each level of aggregation should seek to develop\nan activity system that focuses as exclusively as possible on the key\nreinforcing rods through which that level has chosen to add value to the\nlevels below it. The aggregator’s primary job is to help the level below\ncompete more effectively through shared activities and transfer of skills.\nThis means having a clear view of how the level wishes to add value and\nthen focusing all of its resources on doing so. Activities that don’t add\nvalue to activity systems below should be minimized, because they\ndestroy value. For example, only if the hair-care category can\ndemonstrate value (from sharing of activities and transfer of skills) that\nis greater than the financial and administrative costs that it imposes on\nHead & Shoulders, Nice ’n Easy, Pantene, Herbal Essences, and so forth,\nshould it exist as a level of aggregation in the corporation.

You go to tab twenty-five; you go to tab forty.”\n\nTales abounded of a particular CEO who seemed to revel in the chance\nto put people on the spot with tough, detailed questions. “I can remember\nthe stories,” Taylor recalls. “Somebody told me, ‘Your objective in this\nmeeting is just to not get humiliated. Get out of it alive.’ Then, when I\nbecame more senior, I had a president tell me, ‘Your job in that meeting\nis to talk anything but strategy. Bring innovation projects, bring\n[advertising] copy, bring material to entertain him. You don’t want him\nmessing around with your strategy. Talk anything but strategy.” This getin-and-get-out approach became deeply embedded in the P&G culture.\n\nWe knew we had to reinvent the process entirely, to actually focus on\nstrategy rather than on budget negotiations or product and marketing\nexecution. We wanted to foster a team-like approach that would allow\nthe CEO to collaborate with the presidents and to help advance their\nthinking in real time. We wanted to create useful dialogue in place of a\none-way, bulletproof presentation. Instead of burying the issues, we\nwanted to talk about them openly. We wanted a new management system\nfor the creation and review of the five strategic choices.\n\nLongtime chief financial officer Clayt Daley, equally tired of all the\nsell-and-defend reviews, agreed that there must be a better way. He\nrecalls, “Management teams, because the [P&G] culture is so strong,\nwere trained for so many years to come in and sell. We wanted to talk\nabout strategic options and alternatives and what things we could plug in\nor take out of the strategy.” This different approach came not from a\ndesire to micromanage strategy from the top but from an understanding\nof the different perspectives the senior team and the business presidents\ncould bring. We believed that the senior leadership team could leverage\nboth its considerable expertise across businesses, functions, and\ngeographies and its unique, enterprise-wide perspective to improve and\ncontextualize a smart strategy developed by\nleaders with deep\nknowledge of a specific business. This combination of breadth and depth\ncould be incredibly powerful.\n\nUnfortunately, the management teams had been trained over decades\nto see strategy reviews as anything but an opportunity to share ideas.\nTraditionally, it had been their job to build an unimpeachable plan and to\ndefend it to the death.

We\nreally wanted to engage in a discussion.”\n\nSo we worked up a new process to begin in the fall of 2001. It was a\nradical change for all involved. Previously, a president would come into\na review meeting with a lengthy PowerPoint presentation, which\ncaptured all the material that he or she wanted to share. The president\nwould go through the deck, slide by slide, revealing the material to the\nmass audience in real time. We changed the meeting completely. It went\nfrom a formal presentation (by the business to management) to a\ndialogue focused on a very few critical strategic issues identified in\nadvance.\n\nWhatever strategic issues the president wanted to discuss were\ndelivered in writing in advance of the strategy review meeting. The\nsenior team would review the submission and select the issues it wished\nto discuss (or propose alternative points of discussion). A one-paragraph\nnote (and never more than a one-page letter) would go back to the\npresident, highlighting those issues for discussion. Some meetings\nfocused on a single strategic question, and the team rarely tried to\nwrestle with more than three questions in a single meeting. The culturebusting kickers were threefold. First, there would be no presentation,\nonly a discussion of the strategic issues agreed on in advance. Second,\nwe limited the number of folks in the room, down from twenty-five to\njust four or five from the business plus the CEO and the corporate\nleaders who would bring specific experience or knowledge on the\nstrategy issue. Third, participants would not be allowed to bring more\nthan three new pages of material to the meeting to share---we did not\nwant the participants to race off and create yet another PowerPoint deck\nwith answers to the questions raised in the letter. We genuinely wanted to\nhave a conversation about the key strategic issues in the business.\n\nThe questions tended to press on a few key points: was P&G winning\nin this category? Was the business team sure? How did they really know?\nWhat were the opportunities related to unmet consumer needs? What\nwere the most promising innovations and technologies? What were the\nthreats to category or country or channel structural attractiveness? What\ncore capabilities was the business lacking? What was its most troubling\nor threatening competitor?

The group would spend three or four hours chewing on\nthe few critical issues together.\n\nWe had three reasons for the shift in process. First, we wanted to shift\nthe culture of the organization to one that was more dialogue oriented.\nSecond, we wanted to create a structure in which the business teams\ncould truly benefit from the experience and cross-enterprise perspective\nof senior leaders. And finally, we wanted to build the strategic-thinking\ncapabilities of P&G’s executives, asking them to practice thinking\nthrough strategic issues with others in real time. P&G executives are\ngreat operators in the businesses and the functions. The company needed\nits leaders to become better strategists because better, more choiceful\nstrategies would enable yet better operations. P&G needed\nmultidimensional leaders who could both make tough strategic calls and\nlead effective operating teams. The company would need more of these\nmultidimensional leaders to win in an increasingly complex, global, and\ncompetitive world. So, strategy reviews were redesigned to work\nindividual and collective strategic muscles.\n\nThe change created a good deal of angst at first. Slowly but surely,\nthough, the review meeting became what we hoped it would be: an\ninquiry into the competitiveness, effectiveness, and robustness of a\nstrategy. In due course, the presidents came to understand that they\nwouldn’t be judged on whether they had every aspect of their strategy\nbuttoned up but rather on whether they could engage in a productive\nconversation about the real strategic issues in their business. As a result,\nP&G leaders began to do more strategic thinking, to have more strategic\nconversations---not just at strategy reviews, but in the normal course of\nbusiness---and the quality of strategic discourse improved. More\nimportantly, the company saw better choice making, more willingness to\nmake hard calls, and eventually better business results.\n\nThe new system was a stark contrast to the theater that David Taylor\nhad been used to: “A.G.’s role was to elevate my thinking and my team’s\nthinking to come out with a better strategy than we came in with.” Freed\nfrom an obligation to sell a perfect plan or to try to impress the boss,\nTaylor started to enjoy these meetings.

By\n2005, the new approach to strategy reviews was so ingrained and viewed\nby the majority as so superior to the prior system that it would have been\ninconceivable to go back.\n\nThe strategy dialogue went on at all levels of the organization,\nreturning again and again to choices of where to play, how to win,\ncompetitive core capabilities, and management systems. Presidents had\nto submit a monthly letter directly to the CEO and had a monthly or (at\nminimum) quarterly meeting, either in person or on the phone. The\nongoing discussion helped keep the strategy on track and helped give the\nCEO insights into the strategic capabilities of his leaders. In the regular\none-on-one meetings, the first part of the agenda belonged to the\npresident. The strongest presidents leveraged the time to tackle real\nissues and collaborate on the answers, rather than for show and tell.\n\nNew Norms for Dialogue\n\nIn any conversation, organizational or otherwise, people tend to overuse\none particular rhetorical tool at the expense of all the others. People’s\ndefault mode of communication tends to be advocacy---argumentation in\nfavor or their own conclusions and theories, statements about the truth of\ntheir own point of view. To create the kind of strategy dialogue we\nwanted at P&G, people had to shift from that approach to a very different\none.\n\nThe kind of dialogue we wanted to foster is called assertive inquiry.\nBuilt on the work of organizational learning theorist Chris Argyris at\nHarvard Business School, this approach blends the explicit expression of\nyour own thinking (advocacy) with a sincere exploration of the thinking\nof others (inquiry). In other words, it means clearly articulating your own\nideas and sharing the data and reasoning behind them, while genuinely\ninquiring into the thoughts and reasoning of your peers.\n\nTo do this effectively, individuals need to embrace a particular stance\nabout their role in a discussion. The stance we tried to instill at P&G was", "source_file": "Playing_to_Win__How_Strategy_Really_Works_-_AG_Lafley.pdf", "extraction_method": "pdfminer", "ocr_used": false, "has_table": false, "chapter_num": null, "chapter_title": null, "section_num": null, "section_title": null}

Individuals try to explain their own thinking---because\nthey do have a view worth hearing. So, they advocate as clearly as\npossible for their own perspective. But because they remain open to the\npossibility that they may be missing something, two very important\nthings happen. One, they advocate their view as a possibility, not as the\nsingle right answer. Two, they listen carefully and ask questions about\nalternative views. Why? Because, if they might be missing something,\nthe best way to explore that possibility is to understand not what others\nsee, but what they do not.\n\nContrast this to managers who come into the room with the objective\nof convincing others they are right. They will advocate their position in\nthe strongest possible terms, seeking to convince others and to win the\nargument. They will be less inclined to listen, or they will listen with the\nintent of finding flaws in other arguments. Such a stance is a recipe for\ndiscord and impasse.\n\nWe wanted to open dialogue and increase understanding through a\nbalance of advocacy and inquiry. This approach includes three key tools:\n(1) advocating your own position and then inviting responses (e.g., “This\nis how I see the situation, and why; to what extent do you see it\ndifferently?”); (2) paraphrasing what you believe to be the other person’s\nview and inquiring as to the validity of your understanding (e.g., “It\nsounds to me like your argument is this; to what extent does that capture\nyour argument accurately?”); and (3) explaining a gap in your\nunderstanding of the other person’s views, and asking for more\ninformation (e.g., “It sounds like you think this acquisition is a bad idea.\nI’m not sure I understand how you got there. Could you tell me more?”).\nThese kinds of phrases, which blend advocacy and inquiry, can have a\npowerful effect on the group dynamic. While it may feel more forceful to\nadvocate, advocacy is actually a weaker move than balancing advocacy\nand inquiry. Inquiry leads the other person to genuinely reflect and hear\nyour advocacy rather than ignoring it and making their own advocacy in\nresponse.\n\nWe actively fostered this approach to communication at P&G,\nencouraging dialogue in the strategy review sessions, in one-on-one\nmeetings, and all the way to the boardroom.

Over the course of a career, P&G leaders gain practice\ndesigning strategy for brands and products lines, categories, channels,\ncustomer relationships, countries and regions, and functions and\ntechnologies. The idea is to build up strategy muscles over time, in\ndifferent contexts, so that as managers rise in the organization, they are\nwell prepared for the next strategic task. As they succeed, the reward is a\nbigger, tougher, and more complex strategic challenge. This practicemakes-perfect approach to learning strategy explains why so many P&G\nalums go on to become CEOs.\n\nThough P&G has a strong culture of individual achievement, leaders\nalso recognize the importance of teams to the development of strategy.\nNo individual, and certainly not the CEO, would try to craft and deliver a\nstrategy alone. Creating a truly robust strategy takes the capabilities,\nknowledge, and experience of a diverse team---a close-knit group of\ntalented and driven individuals, each aware of how his or her own effort\ncontributes to the success of the group and all dedicated to winning as a\ncollective.\n\nTaking a group of individual high achievers and asking them to work\ntogether to craft strategy is no simple matter. Since strategic choice is a\njudgment call in which nobody can prove that a particular strategy is\nright or the best in advance, there is a fundamental challenge to coming\nto organizational decisions on strategy. Everyone selects and interprets\ndata about the world and comes to a unique conclusion about the best\ncourse of action. Each person tends to embrace a single strategic choice\nas the right answer. That naturally leads to the inclination to attack the\nsupporting logic of opposing choices, creating entrenchment and\nextremism, rather than collaboration and deep consideration of the ideas.\nTo overcome this tendency, P&G needed to create a culture of inquiry\nand norms of communication that allowed individuals and teams to be\nmore rather than less productive.\n\nA Framing Structure\n\nIn any organization, but especially in an organization as large as P&G,\nthere needs to be a framework for organizing the strategy discussion.

A culture of inquiry surfaced\nproductive tensions and enabled deep conversations that advanced\nstrategic thinking. But the company also needed mechanisms for\ncommunicating the core of the P&G strategy to the entire global\norganization. Rather than relying on a trickle-down method, in which the\nCEO communicated to presidents, who communicated to general\nmanagers, and so on, we thought long and hard about how to frame\nmessages for the whole organization.\n\nCommunicating the Strategy\n\nStrategy is formulated at all levels of the organization, and to be\nsuccessful, it needs to be clearly communicated at all levels as well. The\nbusinesses must communicate their strategies to management (in P&G’s\ncase, through reviews and the OGSM), but management must also\ncommunicate the company-level choices to the whole organization. The\nchallenge is to find simple, clear, and compelling ways to do so. A\nmassive binder or thick PowerPoint deck won’t rally an organization. So\nit is important to think explicitly about the core of a strategy and the best\nway to communicate its essence broadly and clearly. Ask, what are the\ncritical strategic choices that everyone in the organization should know\nand understand?\n\nAt P&G, it boiled down to three themes that would enable the\ncompany to win, in the places and ways it had chosen, regardless of the\ndetails of individual differences between businesses:\n\n1. Make the consumer the boss.\n\n2. Win the consumer value equation.\n\n3.

The first dictum, that the consumer is boss, was a reorientation\nto the company’s aspiration---to improve the lives of consumers.

This meant\nproviding unique value to consumers (through brand differentiation and\ninnovative products). And it meant maintaining a cost position that\nwould let P&G offer that value to the consumer at an attractive price and\nstill make a healthy profit. This edict turned everyone’s attention toward\nthe where-to-play and how-to-win choices that create sustainable\ncompetitive advantage through differentiation.\n\nThe third and final message was the vital importance of winning the\ntwo most important moments of truth.4 In consumer terms, the notion\nbehind moments of truth is that a company’s performance is the sum\ntotal of all its interactions with its consumers, the moments in which the\nbrand promise is either realized or not in the consumer’s mind. It is when\nthe consumer enjoys the Gain fragrance for the first time, when Tide\nwith Bleach actually does whiten his whites, and when Cover Girl\nLashBlast mascara dramatically lengthens the look of her lashes. It is\nwhen the product experience reinforces the brand promise and helps start\na first-time purchaser down the path toward repurchase, regular usage,\nand, ultimately, brand loyalty.\n\nThe notion that there are two crucial moments of truth---when the\nconsumer encounters the product in the store for the first time and when\nhe or she first uses at home---was significant for P&G. Previously, the\nwhole company had focused primarily on that second moment---the athome, in-use moment. We wanted to highlight and elevate the\nsignificance of the first moment of truth, illustrating just how important\nthat in-store experience is to winning. Is the product in stock? Is it\nprominently positioned on the shelf? Does the packaging help the\nthe value\nconsumer understand\nproposition? Is it merchandised in a way that reinforces the brand\npromise and builds on it? Does something in the merchandizing and instore marketing compel the consumer to pick up that product, rather than\nthe one right beside it or down the aisle?

It was simple, evocative, and memorable. In any\norganization, the choices at the top must be precisely and evocatively\nstated, so that they are easily understood. Only when the choices are\nclear and simple can they be acted upon---only then can they effectively\nshape choices throughout the rest of the organization.

As Moeller explains, there was one\nimportant question on scale: “Are you capturing that value, both in terms\nof your activity systems and in terms of your economics? We historically\nweren’t. If you go way back, we were really operating as individual\ncountries. We then made an important move to go to global categories.”5\nThe move happened in three steps over a decade. First, under John\nSmale, P&G moved the majority of the US business to a category\nmanagement structure. Under Ed Artzt, P&G created global category\ncoordinators to manage technologies and brands on a more global basis.\nThen, under John Pepper and Durk Jager, the company moved to true\nGBUs---fully resourced global businesses and profit centers. “Those\nmoves got us part of the way” to realizing the true benefits of scale,\nMoeller says.", "source_file": "Playing_to_Win__How_Strategy_Really_Works_-_AG_Lafley.pdf", "extraction_method": "pdfminer", "ocr_used": false, "has_table": false, "chapter_num": null, "chapter_title": null, "section_num": null, "section_title": null}

Even\nadvertising---each division had purchased its own advertising, which was\ncrazy.” Consolidating purchasing globally, whether for advertising or\nchemicals or packaging, dramatically increased P&G’s scale advantage\nand cut costs substantially.\n\nMoeller and Daley also looked carefully at that bane of corporate life:\noverhead. “We had always benchmarked ourselves to competition,”\nMoeller recalls, “to understand whether we were efficient or inefficient\non a relative basis in terms of overhead spent. It was always a straight\nmath comparison. Clayt said, ‘Wait a minute. To the extent that we’re\neffectively scaling ourselves, we should have a lower overhead cost as a\npercentage of our sales.’” In other words, if there was a scale advantage\nat work, P&G’s overhead should be significantly lower than the\ncompetition’s.\n\nDaley wanted a way to better quantify the benefits of scale to\noverhead efficiency. Moeller continues: “We struggled for a year or two\nto put together some modeling on what benefit we should see from\ncategory scale, company scale, country scale, so that we could hold\nourselves accountable to a standard of overhead efficiency that was truly\nreflective of our scale.” Because scale was a critical core competency, it\nwas necessary to build supporting systems and to measure it in\nmeaningful, impactful ways. It wasn’t enough to merely say that scale\nwas important.\n\nP&G has created measurable cost advantages in several of its\nbusinesses (including laundry, fine fragrances, feminine care, and GBS).\nBut it hasn’t quite realized Daley’s desire to have lower-than-average\noverhead as a percentage of sales across all the businesses, functions,\nand geographies. “That’s still a journey that we’re on,” Moeller explains.\n“We’ve done a good job with the conceptual understanding and the\nmodeling.

Deb Henretta, then general manager of\nlaundry, was the executive sponsor, and the team comprised three\noutstanding marketing experts: Lisa Hillenbrand, Leonora Polonsky, and\nRad Ewing. Their work led to the creation of P&G’s brand-building\nframework (BBF) 1.0, which explained P&G’s approach to brand\nbuilding in one coherent document for the first time. In 2003, the team\nupdated the framework and released BBF 2.0 to the organization,\nfollowed by BBF 3.0 in 2006 and BBF 4.0 in 2012. Each version was an\nenhancement over the prior one in comprehensiveness, clarity, and\nactionability.

These\nsystems would prove to be decisive in some cases. Consider SK-II,\nP&G’s super-premium skin-care line.

Measurement provides focus and feedback. Focus comes from\nan awareness that outcomes will be examined, and success or failure\nnoted, creating a personal incentive to perform well.

Henretta had\nher doubts: “As diapers got more and more sophisticated, moms started\nto expect more. It wasn’t just good enough to have the technical\nperformance” on one primary product dimension. In fact, most of the\ndiapers on the market had quite similar levels of performance on the\nabsorbency front. And though tests typically showed its products had\nsuperior absorbency, Pampers wasn’t winning in the marketplace.\n\nHenretta wanted to explore the other measures that might drive\nconsumer preference, purchase, and, over time, loyalty. “We created a\nmetric that would look holistically at all of the components that made up\nproduct or brand preference. Our weighted purchase intent (WPI)\nmeasure looked at a number of product dimensions that included things\nlike the aesthetic appeal, the design, the feel of the diaper, the look of the\ndiaper in addition to technical performance; it also considered the brand\nproposition you were giving to the consumer and the price of the\nproduct.” The goal of WPI was to capture the complete picture, the full\nproposition as presented to consumers. It was to understand all the\ncomponents of the consumer value equation: the drivers of consumer\npreference and the overall perceptions of product and brand value.\n\nThe WPI metric, Henretta says, “started to show where we had\ndeficiencies. Even where we had technical superior performance, we\nfound that we had a WPI disadvantage; when you consider all of the\nways a mom evaluates a baby-care brand, we just weren’t doing enough\non some of the other aspects, like the feel of the diaper, the look of the\ndiaper, the design of the diaper.” The data gave Henretta the ammunition\nshe needed to spur a change in the business: “It was an important part of\nmaking the shift, because we could show the organization, and even my\nleadership team, that we weren’t doing as well on our diapers as we\nthought we were. They had this view that we had far and away the most\nsuperior diaper. They weren’t taking into consideration all these other\npurchase factors that the consumer used when she made her decision on\nwhat brand she was going to buy; she was coming up with a very\ndifferent value equation than our internal technical testing showed.” WPI\nsuggested that factors like the way the baby looked in the diaper and the\nease of putting the infant in the diaper were far more important than\ntechnologists believed. “We proved, market by market, that when we", "source_file": "Playing_to_Win__How_Strategy_Really_Works_-_AG_Lafley.pdf", "extraction_method": "pdfminer", "ocr_used": false, "has_table": false, "chapter_num": null, "chapter_title": null, "section_num": null, "section_title": null}

In many cases, the accepted, traditional industry maps are\nimperfect. Like the old maps of a flat world that showed edges you could\nsail off, industry maps have limitations; only by exploring the edges of\nthose maps can you see things differently.\n\nIn oral care at P&G, for instance, for many years the team thought\nabout the industry in terms of products (brushes, pastes, and rinses) and\nconsumer benefits (a huge segment devoted to cavity prevention and\nsmall segments devoted to appearance and to sensitive teeth). Crest was\nsquarely in the huge and attractive cavity-prevention segment and\nwinning big in the United States; it was number one in the industry for\nmore than thirty years using this conceptualization of the industry\nstructure. But the structure began to change in the 1990s. Cavity\nprevention became a generic benefit, one that every toothpaste brand\ncould claim equally; this meant that other benefits would become\nincreasingly important. On the strength of this insight, ColgatePalmolive invented a new segment---based on a broader, “healthy\nmouth” consumer need---launching Colgate Total (which could fight\ncavities while also targeting tartar, plaque, bad breath, and gingivitis).\nColgate Total came on the market in 1997 and within a year took over\nleading market share in toothpaste.

If it is very difficult for new players to\nenter the industry and there are no substitutes to the industry’s product or\nservices to which buyers can turn, then the industry will generate high\nvalue. This is why the pharmaceutical industry was so profitable through\nthe 1980s and 1990s; it took enormous capital and expertise to get into\nthe business and the buyers generally had little choice but to pay up for\nthe products, which had no substitutes. Contrast this to the airline\nindustry. There, whenever profitability spiked, a slew of new competitors\nentered. Or, compare it to steel, where everything from plastic to\naluminum to ceramics to titanium can be a substitute.\n\nThe horizontal axis determines which entity will capture the industry\nvalue---suppliers, producers, or buyers.

The degree to which there is fierce rivalry\naffects which group captures value too. If rivalry between competitors is\nhigh, the dynamic will facilitate the appropriation of value by suppliers\nor buyers. A low degree of rivalry will protect profitability for the\nproducers.\n\nin setting\n\nAt P&G, the analysis of segment attractiveness was occasionally a\ndecisive factor\nthe strategy. For Bounty, geographic\nsegmentation, paired with an understanding of consumer preferences,\ndemonstrated that the paper-towel business was only structurally\nattractive for P&G in North America, due to massive overcapacity and\nlow willingness to pay in the rest of the world. The industry featured\nhigh rivalry, high buyer power, and plenty of substitutes. When assessing\nsegment attractiveness for Crest, P&G came to realize that the health\nsegment was not only the largest, but also the most structurally\nattractive. Health claims need to be backed by clinical trials, and few\ncompanies---really only P&G and Colgate-Palmolive---have\nthe\nresources and experience to play that game on an ongoing basis. This\nkind of analysis---crunching the numbers on the size and appeal of\ndifferent segments---is crucial to determining the range of attractive\nwhere-to-play choices.\n\nIn general, P&G worked to tilt the weight of its portfolio toward more\nstructurally attractive businesses, looking for businesses whose suppliers\nhad little power to raise input costs. In beauty, for instance, purchased\ninputs were relatively low in value, making the sector more attractive to\nP&G.\n\nIndustries with fewer rivals and with competitors that seek to serve\ndifferent parts of the market with unique offerings are more attractive\nthan those in which a number of competitors compete fiercely for the\nsame consumers in the same way. P&G favored beauty and personal\ncare, including feminine care, because these were industries with low\ncapital cost in which highly fragmented rivals attempted to differentiate\ntheir products in unique ways.

This diminishes\nstructural attractiveness.\n\nPorter’s five forces help define the fundamental attractiveness of a\ngiven industry and its individual segments. Understanding structural\nattractiveness allows individual managers to determine how to invest in\nvarious segments within their business. For instance, the fine-fragrances\nbusiness was able to initially avoid the intense competition in women’s\nfragrances by starting with Hugo Boss in the more structurally attractive\nmen’s fragrance segment. Men’s fragrance was more attractive because it\nwas a smaller part of the market and most big competitors overlooked it\nto focus on women’s prestige fragrances. After the business found its\nfooting in men’s fragrances, fine fragrances could leverage P&G’s\nstrengths to make the women’s fragrance segment more attractive.\n\nIndustry analysis also enables a company to migrate its portfolio\ntoward more structurally attractive businesses and away from less\nattractive ones. An analysis of the declining attractiveness of the hardsurface cleaner segment, for instance, led the category team to sell off\nSpic ’n Span and Comet, allocating resources to create new segments\nwith Febreze (fabric odor removal) and Swiffer (quick floor cleaning),\nboth much more structurally attractive than the traditional hard-surface\ncleaner segment and more conducive to building competitive advantage.\n\nCustomer Value Analysis\n\nArmed with a map of the playing field and an analysis of the structural\nattractiveness of the individual segments, the strategist can move to the\nsecond major category in this framework: an analysis of customer value.\nRegardless of whether a firm wishes to be a cost leader or a\ndifferentiator, it needs to understand precisely what customers (its own\nand its competitors’ customers) value. This means understanding\nunderlying needs, like recognizing, with Gain, that a sizable group of\nconsumers cared deeply about the sensory experience of doing laundry,\nvaluing the scent of the detergent in the box, in the wash, and in the\ndrawer or closet. Only once this need was understood was it possible to\nposition and differentiate Gain along this dimension.\n\nThe logic flow diagram indicates two levels of customers, which may\nor may not be the case for a given firm.

So, given that\nP&G needs retailers to stock Gain, the company needs to offer a\ncompelling value proposition to retailers, or the end consumer will never\nsee the product. Wherever there is an intermediary channel between the\nfirm and the end consumer, that intermediate customer and what it values\nmust be understood. Wherever there is no intermediate customer or\nchannel (like a retail bank, for example, which offers services directly to\nits consumers), a direct-to-consumer or solely business-to-business firm\ncan eliminate the channel box from the diagram.\n\nIn customer value analysis, the company assesses what its channel\ncustomers and end consumers really want and need, and what value they\nderive from the firm’s products and services relative to the costs they\nincur from buying and using the products or services. For P&G, that\nmeans considering both its retail customers (like Walmart, Kroger, and\nWalgreens) and the consumers who actually buy and use the products.\nThese two groups have different, and sometimes contradictory, benefits\nand costs.

In\ndepartment and specialty stores, the manufacturer staffs its own mini\nbeauty store within a larger retail format. Such a structure adds\nconsiderable complexity and lots of costs as the numerous cosmetics and\nskin-care competitors ratchet up the grandeur of their space and their\nlevel of staffing.

These\nteams were colocated near P&G’s largest customers, like Walmart,\nTarget, and Tesco. The post-1999 focus on core customers---those who\naccounted for an overwhelming share of P&G sales and profits---helped\nredefine the role of these multifunctional customer teams. Their job was\nto understand their customer so well that they could work collaboratively\nto develop mutual business goals, joint value creation strategies, and\nshared action plans to win.

Recall Henry Ford’s famous\nquip that if, at the dawn of the automotive industry, he’d asked\nconsumers what they wanted, they would have said, “A faster horse.” To\nunderstand the consumer value equation, you must truly get to know\nyour consumers---to engage with them beyond the quantitative survey,\nthrough deeper, more personal forms of research---watching them shop,\nlistening to their stories, visiting them at home to observe how they use\nand evaluate your products. Only through this kind of deep user\nunderstanding can you hope to generate insights about where to play and\nhow to win.\n\nSo it was with baby diapers. By focusing entirely on technology\n(making the diaper more and more absorbent), the category had lost\ntouch with mom. When it reengaged with her, the diaper team found out\nthat while absorbency was important, so too were a soft, cloth-like feel,\neasy-to-use tabs, a snug but comfortable waist, and even a fun design. It\nturned out that mothers valued familiar characters, like the Sesame Street\ngang, over the nondescript cartoon bears P&G had been using.\nUnderstanding mothers better also led the business to change how it\n“sized” the diapers, moving from a weight-based designation (e.g., for\nfifteen- to twenty-pound babies) to life stage (like Swaddlers and\nCruisers) that matched with how mom thought about her baby.\n\nTo better understand the end consumer, P&G spent much of the\ndecade of the 2000s retooling the Market Research Department, which\nhad historically focused on doing highly quantitative consumer research\n(to choose between product, packaging, and marketing options and to\nforecast volume for product launches and initiatives), into Consumer and\nMarket Knowledge (CMK), a group capable of employing both\nquantitative and qualitative research approaches, together with worldin decision modeling, such as agent-based\nleading\nmodeling, to create a robust picture of markets, segments, and\nconsumers.

These are the\nkey questions to consider on this front: does the organization have a\nscale, branding, or product development advantage that enables it to\ndeliver a superior value offering at the same cost as the cost incurred by\ncompetitors? Or, does it have a scale advantage, a learning-curve\nadvantage, a proprietary process, or a technology that enables it to have a\nsuperior cost position? The answers to these questions start to put\nparameters around the myriad how-to-win options.\n\nAt P&G, costs have been a particularly crucial concern for highly\nprice-sensitive industries and categories like fabric care, family care,\nand, of course, emerging markets, where incomes are much lower. As\ndetailed elsewhere in this book, P&G needed to find new ways to deliver\nan affordable diaper, razor, or shampoo, customized to market conditions\nand matching the ability of consumers to pay.

But\nforming a thoughtful hypothesis is important. It is far better to ask what\nyour competitors will likely do before you proceed than to simply wait\nand see what happens. Only strategies that provide a sustainable\nadvantage---or a significant lead in developing future advantages---are\nworth investing in.

A strategy\nthat only works if competitors continue to do exactly what they are\nalready doing is a dangerous strategy indeed.\n\nAn analysis of the competitive landscape and potential competitive\nreaction was particularly decisive in the Impress and ForceFlex\ntechnologies, the bags and wraps innovations that would eventually form\nthe basis of P&G’s joint venture with Glad.

Martin\n\nLooking back on it, I see that the journey toward the strategy logic flow was long\nand winding. One wouldn’t have thought so, with Michael Porter providing the\nfoundational intellectual property with his smash hit 1980 book Competitive\nStrategy and its 1985 follow-up Competitive Advantage. Just read the book, and\ndo strategy! Sadly, it wasn’t quite that simple for me.\n\nIn my early Monitor days, it was striking how many clients simply asked for\nindividual analyses that they’d read about in Porter’s book: “Do a five-forces\nanalysis for us; do a competitor analysis for us.” So we did. It was considerably\ntougher when a client asked us to devise a better strategy for the company. But\nmy Monitor colleagues and I were bright and energetic and steeped in Porter’s\ntools, so we could always go back to the office, get to thinking, and pull\nsomething good out of the proverbial black box. The real trick, though, was when\nclients asked us to teach them how to do strategy, to show them how to get from\nan unsatisfactory strategy to a great one themselves. That was something much,\nmuch harder to do.\n\nIn 1987, Eaton Corporation hired us to do just that: work with its various\ndivisions to teach them how to create great strategies. I was dispatched to Battle\nCreek, Michigan, to work with their truck axle business. As I went through the first\ntraining session, I became painfully aware that I was teaching the Eaton\nmanagers a series of analytical tools related to strategy, rather than a holistic\nprocess for creating strategy.

Just read the book, and\ndo strategy! Sadly, it wasn’t quite that simple for me.\n\nIn my early Monitor days, it was striking how many clients simply asked for\nindividual analyses that they’d read about in Porter’s book: “Do a five-forces\nanalysis for us; do a competitor analysis for us.” So we did. It was considerably\ntougher when a client asked us to devise a better strategy for the company. But\nmy Monitor colleagues and I were bright and energetic and steeped in Porter’s\ntools, so we could always go back to the office, get to thinking, and pull\nsomething good out of the proverbial black box. The real trick, though, was when\nclients asked us to teach them how to do strategy, to show them how to get from\nan unsatisfactory strategy to a great one themselves. That was something much,\nmuch harder to do.\n\nIn 1987, Eaton Corporation hired us to do just that: work with its various\ndivisions to teach them how to create great strategies. I was dispatched to Battle\nCreek, Michigan, to work with their truck axle business.

Frame the Choice\n\nAs a general rule, an issue---for example, declining sales or technology\nchange in the industry---can’t be resolved until it is framed as a choice.\nUntil a real choice (e.g., should the company go in this direction or that\none?) is articulated, team members can’t understand cognitively or feel\nemotionally the consequences of the different ways to resolve the issue.\nA team could talk endlessly about declining sales, making no progress\ntoward solving the problem. But crystallizing the issue by clearly\nframing the choices for resolving it makes the issue immediately real and\nmeaningful. For example, a team might ask, should it invest to\nreinvigorate the product line, cut costs through head-count reductions, or\nexit the business entirely? Articulating options provides a gut check. The\nteam can ask, how do those choices feel, and more importantly, what\nwould it need to know to decide on the best choice?\n\nTo frame the choice, explicitly ask, what are the different ways of\nresolving this problem?

Here is the opportunity\nto encourage creative and more-unexpected strategies. In this context, a\npossibility should be expressed as a narrative or scenario, a happy story\nthat describes a positive outcome. That is why we like to call them\npossibilities rather than options. Characterizing the possibilities as stories\nhelps ensure that they are not seen negatively as unsubstantiated\nopinions. No one is yet arguing for a possibility; you and your colleagues\nare simply envisioning a world in which that story makes good sense.\n\nPossibilities should be welcomed at this stage, not thoroughly vetted\nfor inclusion. Suggested possibilities should never be trivialized or\ndismissed, lest that discourage the inclusion of more out-of-the-box ideas\nin the consideration set. Within the group, there must be a fundamental\ncommitment to openness, such that if any member of the group feels that\na given possibility is worth exploring, it should automatically be\nincluded in the choice set. Culling a possibility about which a particular\nindividual feels strongly may well cause that individual to withdraw,\nperhaps for the rest of the process.

Specify Conditions\n\nOnce a diverse set of possibilities is established, the team then needs to\nreverse engineer the logic of each possibility.

Tempers rise, statements get more\nextreme, and relationships are strained. Meanwhile, little new or helpful\ninformation emerges. If instead the dialogue is about what would have to\nbe true, then the skeptic can say, “For me to be confident in this\npossibility, we would have to know that consumers would respond in the\nfollowing way.” This is a very different sort of statement than “That\noption will never work! Consumers hate that approach.” Rather than a\nblanket denunciation of a possibility, skeptics in the reverse-engineering\nprocess must specify the exact source of their skepticism. This frame\nhelps the possibility’s proponents understand the reservations and creates\na standard of proof to address them.\n\nThis process is a form of reverse engineering because the starting\npoint is the (tentative) assumption that the conclusion is valid---namely,\nthat this is a great possibility.

These conditions constitute\nthe barriers that keep you and the team from choosing that possibility.\nUntil you know if they are true or not, you can’t move ahead.\n\nIn this step, it is extremely important to pay close attention to the\ngroup member who is the most skeptical that a condition will hold true; a\nskeptic can provide extremely valuable insurance against making a bad\nchoice. So skeptical group members must be encouraged to raise, not\nsuppress, concerns at this point in the process.

But not\nall companies can afford full market tests; nor are pilots practical for\nevery instance. In some cases, you need to be creative about tests,\nperhaps looking at analogous industries in which repositioning created\nloyal customers or failed to do so. P&G did this for competitive reaction\n---without actually inciting the feared reaction in the market, the team\nprojected possible outcomes according to past reactions to determine\nwhat each competitor might do.\n\nAt this point, the critical issue is whether the decision-making group\nregards the test as valid. In this sense, the most skeptical member of the\nteam is the most valuable. Typically, this person will have the highest\nstandard of proof for any test, and building his or her commitment to the\nchoice will be the most challenging. However, without his or her\ncommitment, any consensus will inevitably be false. Hence, the most\neffective approach to overcoming barriers is to put the test design for\neach barrier condition in the hands of that condition’s greatest skeptic. If\nthat person is satisfied that a test is rigorous and that the standard of\nproof has been passed, then everybody else---who is by definition less\nskeptical---will also be satisfied that the test is legitimate and stringent.\n\nThe danger, of course, is that this approach will result in the skeptic’s\nsetting an unachievable standard to undermine the possibility. This could\ntheoretically happen. However, empirically, it does not happen, for two\nreasons. First, people demonstrate extremes of skepticism largely\nbecause they don’t feel heard. In a typical buy-in process, concerns are\nroadblocks to be pushed out of the way as quickly and thoroughly as\npossible. The reverse-engineering process, by contrast, makes sure that\nindividuals with concerns feel heard and actually are heard. Second,\nthere is the specter of mutually assured destruction. Though I may have\nserious doubts about possibility A, I quite like possibility B. You, on the\nother hand, have few doubts about possibility A, but serious barriers to\nchoosing possibility B. I get to set the tests for the barrier conditions for\npossibility A, but I do so in the knowledge that you will get to set the\ntests for possibility B. If I set an unrealistically high bar for the tests for\nA, you will surely do the same for B. Being fair is the smartest approach\nto ensure the best outcome for the organization---something all\nparticipants both desire.\n\nThe ultimate goal is to design tests that will enable each member of\nthe group to put hand on heart and commit to making a choice, and to\nsupporting it thereafter, if the possibility passes the test.

Conduct Tests\n\nThe test design process leads to the actual testing phase and the analysis\nof results. Here, we recommend taking what we sometimes call the lazy\nperson’s approach to strategy. Simply put, first test the things you’re\nmost dubious about. Take the condition the team feels is the least likely\nto hold up, and test it first. If the team’s suspicion is right, that possibility\nwill be eliminated without the need to test any of the other conditions.\nThe possibility has already failed an essential test, so no more tests are\nnecessary. If, on the other hand, the possibility passes the first test, move\non to the condition with the next-lowest confidence level, and so on.\nSince testing is often the most expensive and time-consuming part of the\nchoice process, this approach can save enormous amounts of resources,\nreducing the number of tests that must be performed in total, as\npossibilities fall away after just one or two tests.\n\nThis is an important feature by which the reverse-engineering process\ndiverges profoundly from the process used in most strategy efforts. The\ntypical process, whether internal or outsourced to consultants, features a\nrelatively standard suite of analyses. Rather than frame the choice,\nunderstand the conditions, order the barriers, and analyze only the\nbinding constraints---as the team does in reverse engineering---the\ntypical approach analyzes everything in parallel. That means, in practice,\na whole lot of analysis, much of which is not essential to making the\ndecision. Furthermore, because of the wide scope of analysis, the\nstandard process tends to accidentally sacrifice depth for breadth (i.e.,\nanalyses are a mile wide and an inch deep because the time and financial\ncosts to do a deep analysis across the board would be prohibitive). To\ngenerate choice and commitment, companies actually need analysis that\nis an inch wide and a mile deep---focused precisely on the concerns that\nprevent the team from choosing and going deep enough in that particular\narea to meet the team’s standard of proof.

Then P&G needed to convince itself\nthat it would be able to create that holistic masstige user experience in\nconjunction with its key retail partners.

With the stakes high and the\nlogic poorly articulated, these meetings and the resultant choices rarely\nwork out terribly well.

In the realm of strategy,\nmine sure did. The most demoralizing experience in my consulting career\nbecame my most important lesson.\n\nIn 1990, I was working with the newly appointed CEO of a regional consumer\nproducts company. The firm (unnamed here, for obvious reasons) had dominant\nmarket share in its relatively small market. During the engagement, an investment\nbank approached the CEO with a chance to bid for the leading competitor in a\ncontiguous region. The target had been acquired several years earlier in a\nleveraged buy-out for a price of $180 million. The company was now being\noffered at $120 million. Intrigued, the CEO asked me to conduct an analysis of\nthe opportunity.\n\nMy team performed a detailed analysis and came to the conclusion that the\nacquisition was a bad idea. The competitive dynamics of the target’s regional\nmarket suggested a bleak future for the offered firm. While the target did have the\nleading share, its position was being rapidly eroded by a new low-cost entrant\nthat had turned a happy duopoly into a tough three-way battle. This was an\nindustry in which only the top two players tended to make decent returns,\nbecause of the scale economies of distribution, and the target was arguably the\nmost vulnerable of the three players. No wonder the buy-out firm was attempting\nto unload it at a substantial loss. My client was tempted by the discounted price\ntag, but even at $120 million, this was clearly a very bad idea---and we told him\nso in our presentation.\n\nThe CEO acted on our analysis and told the investment bankers that he’d pass\non the opportunity. So far, so good. However, about a year later, the CEO called\nto inform me that he could now acquire the target for a pittance---just $20 million.\nI begged him not to do it until I updated the analysis, and he agreed to give me\nthe weekend. I dived back in. One more year of market share and financial\ninformation confirmed to me that the target was in a death spiral. While it had\nmade a profit in 1990, I projected that by 1992, it would be in a loss position. I\ncouldn’t see any way that the end could be stopped or even slowed.\n\nI came back with a deck of about a hundred slides. The cover note was\nsuccinct and to the point: “Your answer should be ‘no’ at any price. If you buy this,\nyou will destroy the company and your career. Please don’t do it. Please just say\nno.”\n\nHe said yes. He bought the company at $20 million. At that price, the CEO\nsaid, a number one market share player with a strong branded position was a\nsteal, an opportunity that simply couldn’t be passed up.\n\nHe should have passed. The acquired company went almost immediately into\nthe red. Losses accelerated. Because of prohibitive shutdown costs, the acquired\nbusiness became unsalable at any price. The parent company went into a\nperformance swoon and had to start selling off well-performing divisions to fund\nthe losses at the acquired company. In 1994, the CEO was fired. In 1999, the\nonce strong and independent parent company was folded into a much bigger\ncompany.

I went on to other clients and continued to practice the\nway I had always practiced. But now I was bothered by a nagging question. Why\nhad this intelligent and to-then successful CEO acted as he had? What led him to\nignore the advice he had paid me for? I didn’t have a good answer, and the\nquestion kept rolling around in my head.\n\nThen, in 1994, I was consulting to a mining company that was facing a\ndecision to invest in an aging mine or close it down. We held a meeting with a\ngroup of about ten executives, split evenly between those from the mine and\nthose from the head office. There were plenty of options on the table and many\nopinions about the options. Suddenly, I had a flashback to the acquisition\nexperience; in that moment, I realized that while I had a strong view as to which\nof the options was best, it actually didn’t matter a whit what I thought. I now\nunderstood that what mattered was what the rest of the folks around the table\nthought; they were the ones who were going to have to take action one way or\nthe other, not me. Unfortunately, they were all over the map. The mine managers\nand head-office managers were on opposite pages; head office favored the\nshutdown option, and mine management favored a variety of investment options.\nAt an impasse, an idea popped into my head. Rather than have them talk\nabout what they thought was true about the various options, I would ask them to\nspecify what would have to be true for the option on the table to be a fantastic\nchoice. The result was magical. Clashing views turned into collaboration to really\nunderstand the logic of the options. Rather than having people attempt to\nconvince others of the merits of options, the options themselves did the\nconvincing (or failed to do so). In this moment, the best role of the consultant\nbecame clear to me: don’t attempt to convince clients which choice is best; run a\nprocess that enables them to convince themselves.\n\nAround the same time, I was consulting to an R&D-intensive industrial\nproducts company on its strategy. As part of my work there, company leaders\nasked me to help them with their advanced research portfolio. They were\nexperiencing low success rates out of the portfolio, and problematically, projects\nwould incur lots of expenses before being killed relatively close to the point of\ncommercialization when it became clear that the business case didn’t make\nsense. They asked for help in thinking about how to improve the process.\n\nExcited about my discovery, I trotted out my new favorite question: what would\nhave to be true? Early on in the life of a research project, we would ask, what\nwould have to be true about each box of the logic flow diagram for this project to\nproduce a commercial success? This marked the first time that I used the logic\nflow in this fashion. Again, the impact was immediate and positive. Some projects\nwere canceled because once conditions were laid out, it was clear to the\nresearch team that the project had no hope of commercialization: all those\nconditions simply couldn’t be true. For other projects, the order of activities\nchanged dramatically. The “what would have to be true?” question revealed that\ncertain issues had to be addressed right away, rather than after lots of additional\nspending had been done on less important questions.\n\nFrom there, I used the most important question in strategy---what would have\nto be true?---to build an entirely new methodology for thinking through choices.

This means\nchoosing what business or businesses to be in and which to exit, to shut down, or\nnot to enter. This means balancing the delivery of an acceptable return from\ncurrent businesses and investing in businesses that will ensure steady growth\nand a strong return in the future. This means setting the standards for how an\norganization will behave and setting the bar high for performance. In contrast to\nthe CEO, most company employees are more inward-focused. The content of\ntheir work and the nature of their working relationships inevitably draw their\nattention inside the company. The CEO may well be tempted to turn his or her\nattention inward as well, but consciously choosing a very few external advisers\nand counselors can help a CEO maintain and sustain that all-important external\nfocus.\n\nThe board of directors is one important resource on this front. P&G added\nannual in-depth assessments of the overall company strategy to the board\nagenda.

Nevertheless, P&G would sometimes engage outside\nstrategy consultants to help it with a specific opportunity.

For instance, the company commissioned a broad and deep\nassessment of the health-care industry to help clarify where P&G might play with\ncompetitive advantage. P&G commissioned studies of certain service sectors and\nof franchising business models. It also commissioned studies of specific\ncapabilities---for example, global business services, purchasing, or strategic\nrevenue management---to ascertain how P&G’s capabilities stacked up against\nthese strategic studies were\nbest-in-class global competitors.

Still others stayed (and some remain) open issues.\n\nRoger and I were determined to put a robust strategic process in place\nthroughout P&G---the process Roger had honed at Monitor and simplified and\ncustomized to suit P&G. I invited Roger to P&G’s first board of directors strategy\nreview, where he patiently walked the outside directors through the strategic\nmethodology that he and I had worked out. We wanted the directors to\nunderstand that our integrated set of choices approach centered on where to play\nand how to win.

He had anytime access to me (and I to him). More\nimportantly, he built strong relationships with most of the business and functional\nleaders. I encouraged P&G leaders to work on strategic issues and questions\ndirectly with Roger or with me in real time.

But he was\nhelping me build the strategic capability of the organization by teaching P&G’s\nstrategy methodology in internal training sessions; by coaching business\nleadership teams who “hired him” to assess and review their business strategy;\nand by assessing and evaluating the strategic thinking skills and strategic\nleadership effectiveness of the company’s presidents and functional leaders.\nTogether, Roger and I were continually assessing individuals as well as coaching\nand teaching to improve strategic capabilities.

The CEO is the chief\nexternal officer with primary responsibility for translating the meaningful outside\ninto winning strategies for the business and the organization. This means\nchoosing what business or businesses to be in and which to exit, to shut down, or\nnot to enter. This means balancing the delivery of an acceptable return from\ncurrent businesses and investing in businesses that will ensure steady growth\nand a strong return in the future. This means setting the standards for how an\norganization will behave and setting the bar high for performance. In contrast to\nthe CEO, most company employees are more inward-focused. The content of\ntheir work and the nature of their working relationships inevitably draw their\nattention inside the company. The CEO may well be tempted to turn his or her\nattention inward as well, but consciously choosing a very few external advisers\nand counselors can help a CEO maintain and sustain that all-important external\nfocus.\n\nThe board of directors is one important resource on this front. P&G added\nannual in-depth assessments of the overall company strategy to the board\nagenda. An entire meeting was dedicated to strategy, with the intent of tapping\ninto the broad and varied experiences of outside directors and drawing on their\nindividual and collective judgment and wisdom. The board brought experience\nand perspective from outside the consumer packaged goods industry. It brought a\nmix of domain and discipline experience, along with a level of objectivity and\nskepticism that added real value.\n\nP&G engaged outside strategic consultants selectively. Most of the strategic\nanalysis and strategy creation for businesses the company knew and understood\nwas done in-house. Nevertheless, P&G would sometimes engage outside\nstrategy consultants to help it with a specific opportunity. McKinsey did some\nimportant strategic work with the company during P&G’s due diligence on Gillette.\nP&G needed to maintain absolute confidentiality and wanted a partner that could\nconfirm or deny the company’s critical hypotheses and objectively assess\nstrategic assumptions. Strategy consultants helped P&G explore industries it was\nconsidering entering. For instance, the company commissioned a broad and deep\nassessment of the health-care industry to help clarify where P&G might play with\ncompetitive advantage. P&G commissioned studies of certain service sectors and\nof franchising business models. It also commissioned studies of specific\ncapabilities---for example, global business services, purchasing, or strategic\nrevenue management---to ascertain how P&G’s capabilities stacked up against\nthese strategic studies were\nbest-in-class global competitors. Most of\nfew were\ncommissioned by\ncommissioned by the company.\n\nfunctions; only a very\n\nthe businesses or\n\nYet, one of the most important decisions I made was to ask Roger Martin to\nbecome my strategy alter ego and partner.

I needed someone whom I could trust implicitly and\nwho could trust me---someone I could work with informally and in complete\nconfidence, someone with intellectual integrity to go with moral integrity,\nemotional intelligence to go with IQ, and the courage to tell the emperor when he\nwas wearing no clothes.\n\nWhen I became CEO, Roger and I would set aside a day at a time, a day we\ncould get away from our calendars, e-mails, and Blackberries, and devote\nourselves to strategic issues---of his or my choosing. We kept a running list of\nstrategic choices to be made and worked through them to resolution. Some were\ndispatched in a single meeting. Others were tackled several times before\nsuccumbing. Still others stayed (and some remain) open issues.\n\nRoger and I were determined to put a robust strategic process in place\nthroughout P&G---the process Roger had honed at Monitor and simplified and\ncustomized to suit P&G. I invited Roger to P&G’s first board of directors strategy\nreview, where he patiently walked the outside directors through the strategic\nmethodology that he and I had worked out. We wanted the directors to\nunderstand that our integrated set of choices approach centered on where to play\nand how to win. From that day on, every time P&G leaders talked or wrote about\ncompany or business unit strategies, they were described in terms of winning\naspirations, where-to-play and how-to-win choices, core capabilities, and\nmanagement systems.\n\nRoger had an open invitation to attend the strategy reviews and would attend\nseveral every year. He had anytime access to me (and I to him). More\nimportantly, he built strong relationships with most of the business and functional\nleaders. I encouraged P&G leaders to work on strategic issues and questions\ndirectly with Roger or with me in real time. Roger adeptly worked these informal\nnetworks to help move business leaders and their businesses ahead strategically.\nI would sometimes “donate” an hour or two of my time with Roger to one of the\nfunctions or the businesses. The strategic ball advanced quite a bit in one-to-one\nmeetings between the presidents and Roger, or between the presidents and me. I\nmet with every president every month initially (every quarter by year ten) to work\non strategy, leadership, and personnel issues. The presidents and I addressed a\njoint agenda collaboratively.\n\nFor the presidents, one of the advantages of working through strategic issues\nwith Roger and not with me directly was that many of them perceived Roger as\nless judgmental and saw the stakes of any given conversation as a bit lower.\nAfter all, he wasn’t writing or signing off on their performance evaluation, deciding\nwhether they would be promoted, or determining their compensation. But he was\nhelping me build the strategic capability of the organization by teaching P&G’s\nstrategy methodology in internal training sessions; by coaching business\nleadership teams who “hired him” to assess and review their business strategy;\nand by assessing and evaluating the strategic thinking skills and strategic\nleadership effectiveness of the company’s presidents and functional leaders.\nTogether, Roger and I were continually assessing individuals as well as coaching\nand teaching to improve strategic capabilities.

First is our dear\ndeparted friend Peter Drucker, who not only shaped management\nthinking over three-quarters of a century, but helped both of us\npersonally and did so in the most generous and caring way. Second is our\nfriend and colleague Michael Porter. Many of the approaches in this\nbook build off his seminal work in strategy. P&G’s decision to engage\nwith Michael on strategy in the mid-1980s was critical to both P&G’s\nstrategic development and our personal journeys in understanding\nstrategy. Third is the great organizational learning scholar Chris Argyris,\nwho taught us the importance of balancing advocacy with inquiry in\ncommunication, a concept that shaped not only our personal practices\nbut the evolution of strategy development at P&G.\n\nIn addition, each of us would like to thank individuals within our\n\npersonal circles.\n\nRoger\n\nMy time at Monitor was seminal to the development of many of the\nideas that contributed to this book.

In microeconomics, the two\ncentral structures are demand and supply, and where they cross, the price\nis determined.\n\nStructure of Demand\n\nDemand is a measure of consumer willingness to purchase a given\nproduct or service. Each individual buyer has his or her own demand\ncurve: if the price is high, the person will buy less; if it is low, he or she\nwill buy more. The utility of the product to each individual will\ndetermine how much is purchased at what price, and not every consumer\nhas the same utility for a given product or service. A hungry person has a\nhigher utility for a turkey sandwich than does a satiated person. So, each\nindividual buyer has his or her own demand curve. Nevertheless, you can\ncalculate the industry demand by aggregating the individual demand\ncurves together.

In such a market, a producer has no choice but to accept\nthe market price.

Mill C stays in\nbusiness, hoping that demand rises and shifts the demand curve out to\ncross the supply curve at the right side of the chart, which would push\nmill C into a profit (and mill A into obscene profits).\n\nSadly, demand rarely rises in the way that mill C hopes. Instead, what\ntypically happens is that new entrants look at competitors like mill A, see\nthe money to be made in the industry, and then figure out a way to enter\nwith even lower costs than those incurred by mill A. These new entrants\nanalyze everything mill A does and then do it a bit better, investing\nhigher levels of capital to produce a low-cost position. The entry of a\nnew low-cost firm (firm Z in figure B-6) pushes the entire supply curve\nto the right, causing the demand curve to cross the supply curve at a\nlower price and the price to fall for all players.\n\nWhereas firm D used to be breakeven on variable costs, it is now\nsubstantially in the hole before fixed costs. Firm C is now breakeven on\na variable-cost basis. In the US scheduled air travel market, firm Z is\nSouthwest Airlines, whose entry and growth has made it increasingly\nrough for all the traditional carriers, which argue that the market is\nirrational.

Michael Porter, Competitive Strategy: Techniques for Analyzing Industries and Competitors\n\n(New York: Simon & Schuster, 1980).\n\n2. In 2007, I (R. M.) wrote a book about integrative thinking (Roger Martin, The Opposable\n\nMind: How Successful Leaders Win Through Integrative Thinking [Boston: Harvard Business\nSchool Press]). In the book, I argue that when highly successful leaders are faced with a difficult\nchoice between opposing models, neither of which is particularly attractive, rather than choose,\nthe leaders generally build a new model that is superior to both models but contains elements of\neach. Because I also write frequently about strategy as choice, as we do in this book, some\nreaders have suggested that I am internally inconsistent: successful leaders either don’t choose\n(per The Opposable Mind) or do choose (per Playing to Win). I would offer a different\nperspective. All the integrative thinkers that I chronicled in The Opposable Mind, from Bob\nYoung of Red Hat to Isadore Sharp of Four Seasons Hotels and Resorts to Victoria Hale of the\nInstitute for One World Health to A.G. Lafley, made many key choices. In fact, all made clear\nand distinctive choices about where to play and how to win. The difference between these leaders\nand their competitors is not in the act of choosing, but rather in the standards they apply to the\nchoice. Integrative thinkers set a high bar for where to play and how to win. They assess existing\noptions or business models against that high bar, and when no existing model offers a reasonable\nprobability of winning, integrative thinkers refuse resolutely to choose between those existing\nalternatives. In my view, there is no inconsistency between integrative thinking and strategy\nchoice making. Integrative thinkers set a high bar to make strategy choices that really pay off for\ntheir organizations.\n\nChapter One\n\n1.
