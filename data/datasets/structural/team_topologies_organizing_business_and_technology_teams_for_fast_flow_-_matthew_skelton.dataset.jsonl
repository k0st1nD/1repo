To survive, enterprises need to unlearn existing command and control structures and instead\nmove authority to leaders with the best information to take action and respond. This book will help\nexecutives and business leaders focus on the key strategies of high-performance teams to effectively\naddress the needs of today and the evolving landscape of tomorrow.”\n\n---Barry O’Reilly, Founder of ExecCamp, Business Advisor, and Author of\nUnlearn and Lean Enterprise\n\n“There is nothing more fundamental to management than how you structure your organization and\nwhat behaviors you encourage. Despite this, few have attempted to catalog and analyze the\norganizational design patterns of IT organizations going through digital, DevOps, and SRE\ntransformations. Skelton and Pais have not only accepted this bold challenge, but they’ve also hit the\nmark by creating an indispensable and unique resource.”\n\n---Damon Edwards, Co-Founder of Rundeck\n\n“Team Topologies provides a much-needed framework for evaluating and optimizing team\norganization for increased flow. Teams that have the right size, the right boundaries, and the right\nlevel of communication are poised to deliver value to the company and satisfaction to the team\nmembers. Team Topologies combines a methodical approach with real-world case studies to unlock\nthe full potential of your tech teams.”\n\n---Greg Burrell, Senior Reliability Engineer at Netflix\n\n“Team Topologies by Matthew Skelton and Manuel Pais is unique. It is going to have a big influence\nacross tech companies. We need a structured and methodical approach to shaping teams for\ncontinuous delivery instead of copying a few Spotify rituals. This is the book.”\n\n---Nick Tune, API Platform Lead, Navico\n\n“At Condé Nast International, [the DevOps Topologies] was crucial in understanding our current\nDevOps state and in defining the vision for our aspirational DevOps operating model. We were able\nto navigate round the pitfalls and organizational anti-patterns as excellently described in the models. .\n. . I am extremely pleased that Matthew and Manuel are growing on the success of the DevOps", "source_file": "Team_Topologies_Organizing_Business_and_Technology_Teams_for_Fast_Flow_-_Matthew_Skelton.pdf", "extraction_method": "pdfminer", "ocr_used": false, "has_table": false}

But\ncultivating and scaling an adaptive ecosystem of such teams is a too-often elusive goal. In Team\nTopologies, Skelton and Pais provide innovative tools and concepts for structuring the next\ngeneration digital operating model. Recommended for CIOs, enterprise architects, and digital product\nstrategists worldwide.”\n\n---Charles Betz, Principal Analyst, Forrester Research\n\n“Matthew Skelton and Manuel Pais say ‘Team Topologies is meant to be a functional book’---and it\nis. It’s well constructed and sign-posted, based in sound thinking, and challenges readers to assume,\nlike them, that an organization is a sociotechnical system or ecosystem. From this assumption comes\npractical suggestions, no prescriptions, and skill in explaining an approach that provides for effective\ntech/human organization design. For anyone in the tech/organization design field, [Team Topologies\nis] well worth reading.”\n\n---Dr. Naomi Stanford, Organization Design Practitioner, Teacher, and Author\n\n“I have found Matthew and Manuel’s work on patterns and language to be incredibly valuable in both\nshaping strategies to transform team contexts over time across our organization, as well as in helping\nbusiness and technology leadership connect with the topics of flow and continuous delivery.”\n\n---Richard James, Head of Digital Technology & Engineering at Nationwide\n\n“Teams are the fundamental building block of organizations, how those teams work and the system\nthey operate in are the difference between average and high performance. This book is a deep well of\ninformation for how you can optimize your organization’s system for your current context.”\n\n---Jeremy Brown, Director, Red Hat Open Innovation Labs EMEA\n\n“DevOps is great, but how do real-world organizations actually structure themselves to do it? You\ncan’t just put everyone on a single, silo-less team, all sitting together in one giant open-plan office\nand going out to lunch or playing foosball together. Team Topologies provides a practical set of\ntemplates for addressing the key DevOps question that other guides leave as an exercise for the\nstudent.”\n\n---Jeff Sussna, Founder & CEO, Sussna Associates, and Author of Designing\nDelivery\n\n“If you’re looking for an analysis of the challenges with the traditional ways of working, and also\nsome practical guidance on mitigation strategies (e.g., new interaction modes, reducing cognitive\nload, and creating appropriate ‘Team APIs’), then this is the book for you!”\n\n---Daniel Bryant, Technical Consultant/Advisor and News Manager at InfoQ", "source_file": "Team_Topologies_Organizing_Business_and_Technology_Teams_for_Fast_Flow_-_Matthew_Skelton.pdf", "extraction_method": "pdfminer", "ocr_used": false, "has_table": false}

Lehman’s laws of software\nevolution, and, in particular, continuing growth, captures the evolutionary\npressure to add capabilities as systems are used and new demands or\nopportunities are perceived. Being able to cope with, and even harness, this\nincreasing complexity raises the importance of dual design arenas: the\ndesign of systems and the design of the organization that creates and\nevolves systems. We have a considerable body of work focused on the\nformer; that is, on systems and software design and architecture, including\nan ever growing number of books on domain driven design and software\narchitecture. Team Topologies addresses the design of the software\ndevelopment organization, with Conway’s law in view.\n\nThe basic thesis [ . . . . ] is that organizations which design systems [\n. . . . ] are constrained to produce designs which are copies of the\ncommunication structures of these organizations. We have seen that\nthis fact has important implications for the management of system\ndesign. Primarily, we have found a criterion for the structuring of\ndesign organizations: a design effort should be organized according\nto the need for communication.1\n\nThe above quote from the conclusion of Mel Conway’s classic paper on\norganizational design for software development is a most fitting beginning\nto this book.

This takes\nConway’s law into account and leverages it to help maintain cohesive\nstructures with clear boundaries and loose coupling (known as the reverse\nConway maneuver, and described herein).\n\nIf this was the extent of it, Team Topologies would be a useful\nelaboration of Conway’s paper, setting it in the current context. Of course,\nTeam Topologies is even more than that. Notably, it identifies four team\npatterns, describing their outcomes, form, and the forces they address and\nare shaped by. Stream-aligned teams are the primary team form. These are\nteams that are optimized for flow, with all they need to effect continuous\ndelivery of value and be fully responsive to the associated feedback cycles.\nThis means that system design seeks not just loose coupling but a\nlowers dependencies and\ndecomposition\ncoordination needs between stream-aligned teams. Complicated-subsystem\nand platform teams reduce load for stream-aligned teams, where the latter\nare internal customers of the former’s subsystem or platform capabilities\n(supporting all phases of development, delivery, and operations for multiple\nstream teams). Enabling teams likewise serve other teams, but they are\nservice providers, helping stream-aligned teams learn new techniques,\ninvestigate new technologies, and so forth, allowing stream-aligned teams\nto retain focus while growing effectiveness.\n\nthat supports\n\nflow and\n\nMatthew Skelton and Manuel Pais have brought their considerable\nexperience to bear, describing what these various team forms need to be\nsuccessful, but also highlighting variations in context, identifying the design\nimplications thereof, and indicating anti-patterns to avoid.

Periods of technical\nand product discovery typically require a highly collaborative environment\n(with overlapping team boundaries) to succeed. But keeping the same\nstructures when discovery is over (established technologies and product)\ncan lead to wasted effort and misunderstandings.\n\nBy emphasizing an adaptive model for organization design and actively\nprioritizing the interrelationship of teams, the Team Topologies approach\nprovides a key technology-agnostic mechanism for modern softwareintensive enterprises to sense when a change in strategy is required (either", "source_file": "Team_Topologies_Organizing_Business_and_Technology_Teams_for_Fast_Flow_-_Matthew_Skelton.pdf", "extraction_method": "pdfminer", "ocr_used": false, "has_table": false}

But what is this law exactly?\n\nIn 1968, the computer systems researcher Mel Conway published a\npaper in Datamation called “How Do Committees Invent?” in which he\nexplored the relationship between organizational structure and the resulting\ndesign of systems. The article is full of sparkling insights, some of which\nwe cover later in this chapter, but this is the phrase that became known as\nConway’s law: “Organizations which design systems . . . are constrained to\nproduce designs which are copies of the communication structures of these\norganizations.”6\n\nConway based his observation on organizations building early\nelectronic computer systems. In his words, this “law” indicates the strong\ncorrelation between an organization’s real communication paths (the value\ncreation structures mentioned by Pflaeging) and the resulting software\narchitecture,7 or what author Allan Kelly calls the “homomorphic force.”8\nThis homomorphic force tends to make things the same shape between the\nsoftware architecture and team structures.

Those of us who have built software\nsystems that had to comply with an “architecture blueprint” can surely\nremember having times when it felt like we were fighting against the\narchitecture rather than it helping steer our work in the right direction.

In particular,\nJames\nat\nThoughtworks, and others came up with the\nidea of applying an “inverse Conway maneuver” (or reverse Conway\nmaneuver), whereby an organization focuses on organizing team structures\nto match the architecture they want the system to exhibit rather than\nexpecting teams to follow a mandated architecture design.10\n\nTeam structures must match\nthe required software\narchitecture or risk producing\nunintended designs.\n\nThe key takeaway here is that thinking of software architecture as a\nstandalone concept that can be designed in isolation and then implemented\nby any group of teams is fundamentally wrong. This gap between\narchitecture and team structures is visible across all types of architectures,\nfrom client-server to SOA and even microservices.

The same happens for any one team by simply adding\nup all the team members’ cognitive capacities.\n\nHowever, we hardly ever discuss cognitive load when assigning\nresponsibilities or software parts to a given team. Perhaps because it’s hard\nto quantify both the available capacity and what the cognitive load will be.\nOr perhaps because the team is expected to adapt to what it’s being asked to\ndo, no questions asked.\n\nWhen cognitive load isn’t considered, teams are spread thin trying to\ncover an excessive amount of responsibilities and domains. Such a team\nlacks bandwidth to pursue mastery of their trade and struggles with the\ncosts of switching contexts.\n\nMiguel Antunes, R&D Principle Software Engineer at OutSystems, a\nlow-code platform vendor, relayed an example of this very challenge. Their\nEngineering Productivity team at OutSystems was five years old.

The team kept growing\nand took on extra responsibilities around continuous integration (CI),\ncontinuous delivery (CD), and infrastructure automation.\n\nVictims of their own success, sprint planning for the now eight-personstrong team was a mix and match of requests across their stack of\nresponsibilities. Prioritization was hard, and the frequent context switching\neven throughout a single sprint led to a dip in people’s motivation.

Naomi Stanford puts it\nlike this: “departments and divisions, systems, and business processes . . .\ncan be designed independently as long as interfaces and boundaries with the\nwider organization form part of the design.”13\n\nRestrict Unnecessary Communication\n\nOne key implication of Conway’s law is that not all communication and\ncollaboration is good.

This creates an unbounded cognitive load on\nteams.\n\nCognitive load also applies to teams that do less coding and more\nexecution of tasks, like a traditional operations or infrastructure team. They\ncan also suffer from excessive cognitive load in terms of domains of\nresponsibility, number of applications they need to operate, and tools they\nneed to manage.\n\nWith a team-first approach, the team’s responsibilities are matched to\nthe cognitive load that the team can handle.

Many\norganizations do not consider the cognitive load on teams when assigning\nresponsibility for parts of a software system, instead assuming that by\nadding more teams to the problem, the cognitive load will be shared across\nthe teams. Instead, the teams will suffer from similar communication and\ninteraction strains as mentioned in Brooks’s law.\n\nIf we stress the team by giving it responsibility for part of the system\nthat is beyond its cognitive load capacity, it ceases to act like a highperforming unit and starts to behave like a loosely associated group of\nindividuals, each trying to accomplish their individual tasks without the\nspace to consider if those are in the team’s best interest.\n\nLimiting the cognitive load for a team means limiting the size of the\nsubsystem or area on which the team works, a tactic suggested by Driskell\nand colleagues in their research paper: “For those settings in which\neffective teamwork is critical, it may be necessary to structure the task to\nmake it less demanding (i.e., by delegating subtasks), so that attention can\nbe maintained on essential task and teamwork cues.24", "source_file": "Team_Topologies_Organizing_Business_and_Technology_Teams_for_Fast_Flow_-_Matthew_Skelton.pdf", "extraction_method": "pdfminer", "ocr_used": false, "has_table": false}

If\nis clearly negative,\norganizations can apply some heuristics to understand if and why cognitive\nload is too high. If it is, the organization needs to take the necessary steps to\nreduce cognitive load, thus ensuring that the team is able to be effective and\nproactive again. Incidentally, this will increase motivational levels within\nthe team as members see more value and purpose in their work.\n\nTrying to determine the cognitive load of software using simple\nmeasures such as lines of code, number of modules, classes, or methods is\nmisguided. Computer researcher Graylin Jay and colleagues found in 2009\nthat some programming languages are more verbose than others (and after\nthe emergence of microservices, polyglot systems became increasingly\nmore common), and teams using more abstractions and reusing code will\nhave smaller but not necessarily simpler codebases.25\n\nWhen measuring cognitive load, what we really care about is the\ndomain complexity---how complex is the problem that we’re trying to solve\nwith software? A domain is a more largely applicable concept than software\nsize. For example, running and evolving a toolchain to support continuous\ndelivery typically requires a fair amount of tool integration and testing.\nSome automation code will be needed, but orders of magnitude less than the\ncode needed for building a customer-facing application.

But the reasoning around relative domain complexity\ncan help shape teams’ responsibilities and boundaries. When in doubt about\nthe complexity of a domain, always prioritize how the responsible team\nfeels about it. Downplaying the complexity (e.g., “There are plenty of tools\nfor continuous delivery---it’s not difficult.”) in order to “fit in” more\ndomains with a single team will only lead to failure.\n\nTo get started, identify distinct domains that each team has to deal with,\nand classify these domains into simple (most of the work has a clear path of\naction), complicated (changes need to be analyzed and might require a few\niterations on the solution to get it right), or complex (solutions require a lot\nof experimentation and discovery). You should finetune the resulting\nclassification by comparing pairs of domains across teams: How does\ndomain A stack against domain B? Do they have similar complexity or is\none clearly more complex than the other? Does the current domain\nclassification reflect that?\n\nThe first heuristic is to assign each domain to a single team. If a domain\nis too large for a team, instead of splitting responsibilities of a single\ndomain to multiple teams, first split the domain into subdomains and then\nassign each new subdomain to a single team. (See Chapter 6 for more help\non how to break down large domains.)\n\nThe second heuristic is that a single team (considering the golden sevento-nine team size) should be able to accommodate two to three “simple”\ndomains.

For example, it’s\nextremely difficult to ensure that a separate QA team will be available to\nevaluate a new feature exactly when the product team finishes it.

A fracture plane is a\nnatural seam in the software system that allows the system to be split easily\ninto two or more parts. This splitting of software is particularly useful with\nmonolithic software. The word monolith itself comes from Greek, meaning\n“single stone.” Traditional stonemasons hit stones at particular angles to\nsplit the rocks in clean segments, taking advantage of their natural fracture\nplanes. We can look for similar fracture planes in software to find the\nnatural split points that lead to software boundaries.\n\nIt is usually best to try to align software boundaries with the different\nbusiness domain areas.

A model acts as a ubiquitous\nlanguage to help communication between software developers and\ndomain experts.

But we need to beware and\nsense for other fracture planes, such as change cadence, risk, regulatory\ncompliance, and so on. Often, a combination of fracture planes will be\nrequired.\n\nFinally, we need to be aware of different types of monoliths impeding\nflow and causing unnecessary dependencies between teams.

These streams are", "source_file": "Team_Topologies_Organizing_Business_and_Technology_Teams_for_Fast_Flow_-_Matthew_Skelton.pdf", "extraction_method": "pdfminer", "ocr_used": false, "has_table": false}

Exactly what is chosen for the streams depends very much on\nthe nature of the organization, but some typical streams might be:\n\n• Citizen-oriented tasks for government online services: applying for a\npassport, paying taxes, or registering for a set of healthcare options\n(task-oriented streams).\n\n• Business banking products: online money management, automation of\n\nbank transactions, invoicing clients (role-oriented streams).\n\n• Online ticket purchasing: searching for tickets, purchasing tickets,\n\nmanaging “My Account” and refunds (activity streams).\n\n• Regional products: European market, North American market, Asian\n\nmarket, etc. (geographical streams).\n\n• Market segment: consumer, small and medium business, enterprise,\n\nlarge corporate (user-type streams).\n\nStream-aligned teams should be aligned to the streams you identify.\nThese high-level streams should match the “change pressure” from the core\nof your organization. If there is no clear or obvious set of change streams,\nthen it is usually beneficial to identify these before going further.\n\n3: Identify a Thinnest Viable Platform (TVP)\nAfter you have identified the most relevant streams for your organization,\nidentify the services needed to support a reliable, swift flow of change in\nthose streams. In practice, these services will form the platform on which\nthe streams depend, but as we noted in Chapter 5, a platform does not have\nto be a huge, expensive investment. On the contrary, a platform can be “just\nbig enough” to meet the flow needs for the streams: anything from a set of\ndocumentation on a wiki that helps teams use the underlying services to a", "source_file": "Team_Topologies_Organizing_Business_and_Technology_Teams_for_Fast_Flow_-_Matthew_Skelton.pdf", "extraction_method": "pdfminer", "ocr_used": false, "has_table": false}

As we have seen in previous\nchapters (especially Chapter 5 and Chapter 7), you need to ensure that your\nteams are populated not just with technologists focused on code or\ncomputer systems but also with people who have other skills. In particular,\nyou need people who understand and practice:\n\n• Team coaching\n• Mentoring (especially of senior staff)\n• Service management (for all kinds of teams and areas, not just for\n\nproduction systems)\n\n• Well-written documentation\n• Process improvement", "source_file": "Team_Topologies_Organizing_Business_and_Technology_Teams_for_Fast_Flow_-_Matthew_Skelton.pdf", "extraction_method": "pdfminer", "ocr_used": false, "has_table": false}
