I wasn’t connecting the goals of my company or the needs of my\nusers back to my work.\n\nI wanted to get better. I wanted to create better products. At that time, the\nLean Startup movement was taking shape and I learned about experimentation.\nAn engineer by background, this spoke to me. “You mean I can test things in my\nwork, just like science? I can use data to inform decisions? Sign me up,” I\nthought.\n\nI eagerly applied all the things I learned to my job as a product manager. I\nstarted seeing traction on my features. I began working with my team better.\nTogether we became a lean, mean experimentation machine. And it worked: our\nproducts became better.\n\nThat experience inspired me. I wanted to learn more. I wanted more chances\nto implement these ways of working. I became a kid in a candy shop, soaking up\nevery process and framework that would make me a better product manager.\n\nA few years later, I began getting invited to share my experiences at conferences. I loved being able to talk about what I learned and how it helped me. I\nsoon realized it was helping other people, too. More and more product managers,\nleaders, and designers came to me for advice. Eventually, in 2014, I became a\nconsultant.\n\nFor the past few years, I have been brought in to teach product managers\nthis systematic way of working. “Our product managers are stuck,” the executives\nwould tell me. “They need to learn how to talk to customers and think experimentally.” The product managers I worked with were eager to learn, usually\ntransferring in from another part of the company with no prior experience. They\nreadily adopted the techniques, so excited to have a framework. I was thrilled.\nHelping people, seeing them get better, I found my calling---developing the\nfuture of product management.\n\nI started writing Escaping the Build Trap two years ago for those very product\n\nmanagers. I wanted to help them become better.\n\nBut that evolved.\nI never intended to take two years to write this book. It was supposed to be a\nthree-month process. But, as I was nearing the end of my first draft, I was also\nchecking back in with the product managers I had been teaching. A pattern had\nemerged. They had slipped back into old habits.\n\n“Why are you not talking to users? Why did you stop experimenting?” I\n\nasked.\n\nThey cited a bunch of systemic problems.", "source_file": "Escaping_the_build_trap_-_Melissa_Perri.pdf", "extraction_method": "pdfminer", "ocr_used": false, "has_table": false, "l1_summary": "I wanted to get better.

I had to get something\nout the door or I’d get in trouble,” said another.\n\nI soon realized that it was not just the product managers that were stuck in\nthe build trap, but the entire organization.

Marquetly was growing rapidly, with revenue growth yearover-year holding steady around 30%. The company hired hundreds of people in\na very short amount of time, assigning them to all sorts of projects. Many of\nthose people were developers, and they soon learned they needed product managers to work with them, after adopting an Agile framework called Scrum.\n\nThey moved marketing people, individuals with no prior experience in product management, into that role to work with the developers because they knew\nthe audience for the school best. Marquetly’s story was similar to those of other\ncompanies I had advised, and I knew that the issues were probably deeper than\njust skill based.\n\nWhen I came into the company, I met with its VP of product, Karen. She had\nbeen hired three months earlier to oversee the dozens of new product managers.\n“I am under a ridiculous amount of pressure,” Karen told me. “The sales\nteam has promised all of these features to enterprise clients. We’ve never serviced people in that market before, and now we have to build everything from\nscratch. I have 20 direct reports and a bunch of deadlines to hit. I have no time to\nbe strategic at all.”\n\nThe sales teams were frustrated, as well, and felt backed into a corner. “We\nneed roadmaps, no one gives us anything to sell. This is how I make my money.\nI’m only out there promising things because the product teams aren’t giving me\nanything,” the head of sales told me.\n\nThe entire organization was at a standoff, with everyone pointing fingers at\none another. All of them cited the lack of product management skills as the problem. “If only our product managers had deeper backlogs,” the CTO lamented.\n“We would be set. We need them to start thinking of more solutions.”\n\nSo I got to work with the product managers.

After about a month and a half, I had to break it to Chris\nthat he needed to hire more experienced people if he wanted to succeed.\n\n“Karen cannot be the only leader they are learning from here,” I explained.\n“She has no time to mentor and coach dozens of people. If you want to grow the\njunior people, you will have to move some of these people back to the content\ndivision and hire real product managers.”\n\n“No, no, we can train them,” he told me. “We can’t hire a ton of new people.\n\nJust keep teaching them. Hire another coach if we need to.”\n\nI continued on with the training and brought in another coach to help. Many\nof the product managers were excited for the frameworks and the guidance. They\nreadily adopted them, and, with some, we saw glimpses of early success in the\nway they approached problems and thought about their work. But that momentum was short lived.\n\nWhen the teams did not have anything to ship by the third month, the leadership team became incensed. “They are not doing their jobs!” said the CEO.\n“We need to ship more features. Why are they not prioritizing better?” All fingers\npointed back to bad product management. But that wasn’t the actual problem.\n\nThe company was running in too many directions. At one point, there were\n20 major projects in progress. When I say major, I really mean major. A new\nmobile app was being developed, along with a new backend system for the teachers to monitor their classes. These were large undertakings, meant for multiple\nteams, but only one product manager---and a junior one at that---and one development team were assigned to each.\n\nThey tried all they could to meet their deadlines, while practicing great product management techniques, but they were not set up for success. Deadlines had\nbeen set before I had come in. The different projects were committed to customers in their contracts. Whenever I suggested that we evaluate whether we should\nreally be building a certain feature, there was a considerable amount of pushback\nfrom the product managers. “Leadership told me to do this. I have to ship this, or\nI won’t get my bonus.” They were handicapped by poor planning and poor strategy.\n\nAt the same time, Marquetly’s revenue growth was declining, and the board\nwas starting to pressure management. More mandates for features started trickling down to the teams. Karen tried all she could to push back, but the leaders\nwere still insistent. “You don’t understand.

They skipped the user\nresearch that they had been so steadily doing; it took time away from them writing up user stories for the development team. They all began focusing on getting\nas many features as possible out the door.\n\nWhen the next release rolled around the following month, they had about 10\nnew features to put out to customers. The leadership team was ecstatic. “That’s\nwhat I’m talking about! This is good product management,” the CTO applauded\nthem heartily at the review session. The next week, they shipped the features.\n\nThen the calls began pouring in. The site was breaking because the features\nthey rushed to launch were not well tested. Teachers were frustrated because\nthere was so much new functionality that got in the way of them trying to accomplish their most important tasks: creating courses and responding to student\ncomments. Many of the teachers decided to take their courses down, and the\naccount managers were left scrambling to bring them back.\n\nA few weeks later, we checked in on the adoption of the features on the student side. Nothing. No one was using them. All that work, all those features, and\nMarquetly was still in the same place. Its revenue growth was declining, and the\ncompany was feeling the heat.\n\nThe problem wasn’t any single person or department’s fault. The organization itself was not set up to succeed, which is what I was explaining to Chris during that meeting.\n\n“I don’t understand. How do other organizations succeed?” he asked. “How\n\ndo they come back from this? What are we doing wrong?”\n\n“It’s not just about the skills of your product managers,” I explained. “Some\nof them were doing well and adopting the right mindset. They were really trying\nto figure out how to deliver value, and had they been given the room to keep\ngoing that route, they would have succeeded. But you have so many organizational issues that are preventing them from succeeding.”\n“Like what?” he asked. “What can we improve?”\n“Tell me, what is the most important thing you can achieve today?” I asked\n\nhim.\n\n“Revenue growth,” he answered easily. “We need it to get back to thirty percent year over year at least.”\n\n“When I asked others in the company, they did not give me that answer,” I\ntold him.

No one is tying it back to your goal---the revenue. You are not\naligned.”\n\nI continued. “A lot of it is due to having too many priorities. Everything is\nnumber one on your project list. You are peanut-buttering your strategy---meaning that you have so many strategic initiatives spread over very few people. You\ncan’t give one team a large objective and expect them to hit major goals in a\nmonth. Those things take time and manpower.

This is a specialized skill set.”\n\nChris looked like he was at the end of his rope but pretty much ready for anything. “So what do I do? The company needs to succeed, Melissa. What can I do\nto fix this?”\n\n“You’re stuck in the build trap, Chris. To get out, you need to change the way\nyou approach software development, both as a company and as a leader.

He pushed the\nboundaries of what was known, and the rest of the company followed.\n\nVisionary-led companies can be very powerful---when you have the right\nvisionary. But, there aren’t too many Steve Jobses floating around. Also, when\nthat visionary leaves, what happens to the product direction? It usually crumbles.\nThis has been something Apple has had to contend with since CEO Tim Cook\ntook over. The world is wondering what is next for Apple, after it has built up its\nexisting products.\n\nOperating as a visionary-led company is not sustainable. Innovation needs to\nbe baked in to the system so that one person is not the weakest link. When you\nhave 5,000 brains working on a problem (as opposed to one), you can harness\nthat power better to succeed.\n\nTechnology-Led\n\nAnother common way of operating is the technology-led company. These companies are driven by the latest and coolest technology. The problem is that they\noften suffer from a lack of a market-facing, value-led strategy.\n\nTechnology is critical to a software company’s success, but it cannot drive the\nproduct strategy. The product strategy must lead. Companies that let their technology lead the way often find themselves spinning their wheels, producing lots\nof very cool things, with no buyers.\n\nProduct strategy connects the business, market, and technology together so\nthat they are all working in harmony. You need to be able to lead with a value\nproposition for your users, or you will not be able to make money.\n\nProduct-Led\n\nThis brings us back to being a product-led company. Product-led companies optimize for their business outcomes, align their product strategy to these goals, and\nthen prioritize the most effective projects that will help develop those products\ninto sustainable drivers of growth.

I printed it for my boss to review and had\nbeen sitting there staring at it for five minutes through teary eyes, the way one\nlooks at a beloved child. It had taken me a full week to prepare. Twenty-one pages\nlong, it consisted of 14 beautifully designed mock-ups and every error case\nknown to man. The developers were going to be so set. There would be no need\nto ask a single question. They would have everything they could possibly imagine\nin their hands to create the “change password” page for our site.\n\nI did not even know what product management was until a few months earlier. At that first job, I learned that the role of the product manager was that of a\ncreator and an arbitrator. We connected the development teams with the business, gathering requirements and translating them into features that people\ncould actually use. I would frequently meet with the sales team to learn about\nwhat our customers were requesting. A few times, we interviewed actual customers to learn about their habits and needs.

I never actually knew what they did with them, but I\nlearned that if I made them really detailed, the engineers wouldn’t need to talk to\nme. According to most of my coworkers, that was considered a plus. So I would\nwrite up enormous documents---20- to 30-page product specifications detailing\nevery single aspect of a given feature. The specifications included what would go\ninto what that feature looked like and how it would function, all the way down to\nthe minute details of what would happen when you push a button. Additionally,\nthey covered scenarios, such as, what if there’s an error state, or what if there’s\nnothing entered in this form when you hit Submit? I was convinced that the\nmore detailed I made the spec, the better I was at being a product manager.\n\nWhen the spec document was done, it would be reviewed by my managers\nand shipped off to the developers.

So, many product managers in Agile\norganizations still operate with this Waterfall mindset.\n\nBeing a great product manager takes a thorough understanding of your\nusers, a careful analysis of your systems, and an ability to see and execute on\nopportunities for your market. When you go through the motions without active\nthinking, you end up with a lot of useless features. We rarely teach product managers how to think, and, even if we do, we don’t measure this thinking for success. Instead, we are praised for writing detailed specifications or for making\nsure the developers are shipping on time.\n\nWhen I ask people how they would define a product manager, I get lots of\ndifferent answers---even from product managers themselves. “Product managers\nare the ones who come up with the ideas for what to build!” Or, “They are the\nvoice of the customer!” And always, “A product manager is the CEO of the product!”\n\nTo understand what the product manager’s role is not, you need to understand the common archetypes of bad product managers. Let’s begin with that last\none, given that I particularly hate it.\n\nThe Mini-CEO\n\nProduct managers are not the mini-CEOs of a product, yet 90% of the job postings I have seen for product managers describe them as being the mini-CEO.\nCEOs have sole authority over many things.

He reminded me that my job was to produce\nvalue, not develop my own ideas. It wasn’t until I found some humility that I was\nable to create products that people loved. Before that, I was building things that\ndid not produce the desired results for my customers, and no one adopted them.\nI also had an unmotivated team that was slow to deliver because they were not\nbought in.”\n\nNick sat there and took it in. “I want to do well at this. Tell me what I have to\n\ndo to get better and build cool products.”\n\n“Start listening to your team. Involve them.

She worked on software for consumer mortgages at a\nlarge retail bank. She came to talk to the team about how she thinks of her role\nand what she does on a daily basis.\n\n“I always start with our mortgage division’s vision in mind,” explained\nMeghan. “That’s our business. The vision is to make it easier and more convenient for mortgage applicants to apply (or for mortgage holders to access), their\ninformation from anywhere.”\n\nMeghan was in charge of improving the experience for first-time mortgage\napplicants. She spent a lot of time talking to and learning from them. “I get really\ninto empathizing with my users and figuring out what frustrates them. I call my\ncustomers Mary and Fred,” she told the Marquetly team. “They live in New York\nCity and are looking for their first home in Connecticut because Mary’s pregnant\nand they want more space. You wouldn’t believe the things they have to go\nthrough to apply for this mortgage. They have gone to their local bank branch\nmultiple times in the past month to meet with a loan officer. They’ve filled out\nmassive amounts of paperwork in the office, sometimes forgetting documents\nthey needed, only to return the next day with them and do it all again. Then\nthey’ve had to wait to see if they were qualified for the amount they needed.”\nMeghan continued to explain the very detailed process the couple had to go\nthrough. It was clear she knew her customers well, and she knew their pain\npoints.\n\nBut how did she decide which pain points to solve? Well, Meghan had\nalready worked with her VP of product to identify the business goal that aligned\nwith the vision of her department: to increase the amount of first-time applications that are submitted. At the time, 60% of first-time applicants who started\nthe mortgage process did not finish with this bank and, instead, turned to competitors that handled the process with more grace.\n\nHer goal was to improve that percentage. So, as she evaluated the customer\nneeds and the problem points in their mortgage service offering, Meghan asked\nherself, “Will this help us increase the likelihood that these people will finish\ntheir application with us?”\n\nThe first thing Meghan wanted to understand was what was driving that\n60% abandonment rate.

Soon they found a pattern: many of the potential clients were asked to\ncome to the office to verify documents, given that this could not be done online.\nMost of the people chose to go to another bank because it took too long to find an\nopen appointment to come in for verification. Meghan followed up with a survey\nto a wider base and found that it was a prevalent issue---only 25% of the people\nwho had this problem actually completed their applications with her bank.\n\nNow that she had identified the problem, Meghan called the team together in\na working session to generate ideas for a solution. They were careful not to jump\nto conclusions immediately, and they came up with several ways to solve the\nproblem, while deciding to run a few short experiments to see which solution\nwas the best.\n\nMeghan explained to our team what one experiment entailed: manually taking on the work to understand how to establish an online system for uploading\nand verifying required documents for mortgages. The team worked with select\nfirst-time applicants and had them email the documents. The bank designated a\nperson to review documents and to approve them during this experiment. Over\nthat time, new applicants completed their applications 90% more often than\nthose who had come into the office to have them verified.\n\nBy running the experiment, Meghan was able to prove the best way to reach\ntheir goal and increase the satisfaction of the users was by building out a way to\nhave everything happen online. “We knew we couldn’t start there, but that was\nour vision for the future. We had to work toward it, understanding more about\neach component along the way.”\n\nFrom there, Meghan’s team worked backward, determining what could be in\nthe first version of the new product, by prioritizing value and understanding\neffort. They decided to expand their successful experiment and to create more\nsustainable ways for users to send in their documentation while applying, but\nthey still left the verification up to human beings.

If you anchor yourself with the\nwhy, you will be more likely to build the right thing,” said Meghan.\n\nStart with Why\n\nNow, let’s talk about what made Meghan and her team so successful. She began\nby asking Why?\n\n• Why are we making everything digital in the mortgage space?\n• Why even do this project?\n• What’s the desired result that we hope to achieve here?\n• What does success look like?\n• What happens if we make it all digital and nobody applies for mortgages?\n• How are we mitigating that risk?\n\nToo often, product managers dive into creating solutions without thinking\nthrough the associated risks. Each of the aforementioned questions represents a\nrisk for Meghan that could potentially kill her project. Why do we do this? In\nmany retail banks and other organizations, product managers are not given the\nopportunity to ask why. They are handed features and solutions from stakeholders or managers. Sometimes, these features are determined and committed during annual budgeting season. Other times, this is just seen as the manager’s job\n---to dictate the solutions to build. When done this way, you invite the risk of failure, due to bias, in the execution of those solutions. All solution ideas are subject\nto bias, organizational or personal. The only way to fight this bias is to learn from\nusers and to experiment.\n\nIn many cases when organizations hand down solutions, they skip setting\nsuccess metrics and goals. Meghan’s project could have gone very differently, if\nthis was the case for her and had she simply been told, “Make the process of\napplying for a mortgage digital so that no one has to apply in person.” Now what\nif she found that her customers did not want to apply online and were more comfortable doing so in the office? What if making the process digital caused the rate\nof completion to decline drastically? How could she have made decisions to correct those things, when she wasn’t given the space to do so?\n\nThe biggest issue I hear from leaders, when I go in to help their organizations become product-led, is that their product managers won’t step up and “own\nthe product.” But, this is a double-edged sword.

As I’ve\nexplained in this chapter, product management is not something you can learn\nin a two-day course, as so many Agile consultancies would like you to believe.\nYou need to develop the skill set through experience and practice, just like any\nother specialty.\n\nDevelopers learn their craft by pairing with senior architects and very experienced developers. A salesperson would learn the ropes from an experienced sales\nleader in their division. This is also what is needed for product management and\nis why it’s important to have experienced people in product management who\ncan pair with the junior people. Yet, as anyone who has ever tried to hire senior\nproduct people knows, there are not many out there on the market. The ones\nwho are available are snapped up quickly. Why are we lacking so many people\nwith experience in this role?\n\nSetting up an associate product management or junior product management\nprogram is key.

They are the ones on the ground\nfloor, talking to users, synthesizing the data, making the decisions from a feature\nperspective. Product managers are usually responsible for a feature or a set of\nfeatures that are part of a larger packaged product.\n\nIt’s a difficult role. The product manager needs to be strategic enough to help\ncraft the vision of the features and how they fit into the overall product but tactical enough to ensure a smooth execution of the solution. They tend to skew more\noperational than strategic at this level because the responsibilities are around the\nshorter-term impact and delivery of features on the roadmap. Think of this as a\nquarterly focus.\n\nThe danger is when a product manager is 100% operational, focusing only\non the process of shipping products and not on optimizing the feature from a\nholistic standpoint.

Instead of working toward a goal and saying no to anything that doesn’t\nget us there, we tend to look for ways to develop more things related to our little\nslice of the product.\n\nIf we take a step back and align the work of these teams to the overall vision\nof the product and strategy (which we talk about in the next section), we find that\nmuch of that work really shouldn’t have been prioritized. When features are stable, we should monitor them but then move on to the more important work\nneeded to support our strategy.\n\nBut, you might be asking: don’t you want teams to own all features so that\nyou have a way to make sure someone is looking after them? Yes and no. To\norganize teams effectively, you need to balance the coverage and scope of teams\nwith the goals you are trying to achieve.\n\nWhen companies are small, you can organize effectively around goals you\nare trying to reach. Consider how TransferWise does it. This London-based company does electronic transfers. You can send money to different countries in\nother currencies with very low fees, compared to what the banks charge. TransferWise has a relatively small number of product teams at around 12. The way\nthey organize their teams---around strategic goals---allows them to stay small\nand still get an immense amount of work done.\n\nOne team is focused on retention, another on implementing new currencies,\nand another on acquiring new users. Each of the teams has ownership of their\ngoal and is judged for success based on their outcomes. They are also allowed to\nwork across all products to do whatever is needed to reach those goals. It takes a\nhuge amount of coordination across the product teams, so everyone is responsible for collaborating intensely with one another. Even though the coordination\nmight seem like a handful, having fewer teams makes them ruthlessly prioritize\naround the most important initiatives. There’s no useless work.\n\nThis structure also creates a nice redundancy throughout the company, so\nthat important information about a single product is not stuck in the head of one\nperson. If someone leaves, they don’t need to worry about all that ingrained\nknowledge going with them. If one team is busy with work, another team doesn’t\nneed to wait for them to fix a bug because they own that piece of the product and\nno one else knows how to fix it.", "source_file": "Escaping_the_build_trap_-_Melissa_Perri.pdf", "extraction_method": "pdfminer", "ocr_used": false, "has_table": false, "l1_summary": "A lot of teams do this to get coverage---ownership over every part of the product.

As companies scale, and especially as they begin to maintain more than one product, this\napproach might not be a viable option. We have to add in another component to\norganizing teams, but we still want to keep the product strategy and the goaloriented nature. In addition to these things, we also look at the value streams of\nthe organization.\n\nA value stream is all of the activities needed to deliver value to the customer.\nThat includes the processes, from discovering the problem, setting the goals, and\nconceiving of the idea, to delivering the actual product or service. Every organization should strive to optimize this flow in order to get value out the door faster to\ncustomers. To do that, it makes sense to organize your teams around the value\nstream.\n\nHow do you organize this way? First you begin with the customer or user---\nwhomever is consuming your product at the end of the day. What is the value\nthat you are providing them? Then work backward. What are the touchpoints\nthey have with your company on the way to receiving that value? Having identified these, how do you organize to optimize and streamline that journey for\nthem? How do you optimize to provide more value, faster?\n\nMany companies are confused by the word product. You say product and people think of an app, a feature, or an interface. If you think back to our diagram on\nthe value exchange in Figure 1-1, products are vehicles for value. So, if your app,\ninterface, or feature is not inherently adding value on its own, it’s just a piece of\nthe entire product. That doesn’t mean no one needs to manage it. It just means\nyou have to look beyond just that piece to understand how to manage for value\ndelivery and creation.\n\nConsider an insurance company. The products for an insurance company\nare what they sell to customers: car insurance, home insurance, life insurance,\nand so on. I buy car insurance because it provides me with peace of mind in case\nI get into an accident---that’s value. Having an iPhone app that allows you to\nmanage your car insurance, for example, is only a piece of that product’s value\nstream. That app can help get me more information on my insurance policy or\nfind options if I get in an accident. This functionality is valuable to me, but the\napp on its own is not enough value. I still need the car insurance product.\n\nYou can still have a product manager owning that iPhone app’s experience,\nbut you must make sure that they are part of the larger division that holds the\ntrue value---the car insurance division.

This approach allows you to really evaluate the work\nhappening on your teams and to make sure it’s essential to achieving your strategy.\n\nAs your company scales to include more products, you will need more levels\nof management to effectively oversee the various areas.

You have everyone spread around components of features, but there is no one pulling together a holistic vision for each\nvalue stream. For example, you want to grow the teacher platform such that they\ncan upload their videos and create courses.

As the internet\nbecame faster, the company expected to see more people downloading videos on\ndemand rather than receiving DVDs by mail. It made sense from a strategy\nstandpoint---instant entertainment is definitely convenient. And yet, not as many\npeople were adopting this offering as they had hoped. Why?\n\nStepping back and looking at the situation from the customer’s point of\nview, Netflix realized that the only internet-enabled devices at the time were laptops and home computers. That wasn’t the most convenient or delightful way to\nwatch movies all of the time. Occasionally, yes, but it wasn’t the preferred way to\nconstantly consume entertainment. Most people would rather watch them on a\nbig screen with family and friends. This was a problem the company decided to\ntackle in order to lead the streaming market. It decided to create a way for subscribes to watch content on any device.\n\nSo, Netflix decided to build its own internet-connected device that plugged\ninto TVs. They called it Project Griffin.3 The company spent years developing the\nproduct, testing and validating the device. Everyone was amped. Then, a few days\nbefore launch in 2007, Reed Hastings sent out an email to the entire company\nsaying to stop production on it. “Just kill it”, he said.\n\nAll that time, all that money, wiped out, a few days before launch. Why?\nHastings realized that if he launched a hardware device, he could not partner\nwith anyone else. He would be in the business of hardware, not software or\nentertainment. That wasn’t part of the Netflix core vision. So, he made the hard\ncall and decided to stop a project, even when it was so close to being done,\nbecause it did not align with the overall strategy.\n\nInstead, Netflix spun off Project Griffin as a separate company, which you\nknow today as Roku. Then it turned its sights to finding a partner with a device\nfor which they could build an app. They approached Microsoft, and, six months\nlater, Netflix was enabled on more than one million Xbox devices, accomplishing\nthe goal of gaining more streaming customers.\n\nThe Netflix story is the epitome of excellent strategy, and we’re lucky that\nthey’ve talked openly about it so that we can learn from it.

They didn’t help, and they marginally hurt.\nThe reason we won is because we improved our everyday service of shipping and delivering. That experience grounded us. Executing better on the\ncore mission is the way to win.\n\nLuckily, the company realized this sooner rather than later, and, by turning\nback to its strategic framework and core mission to make people happy, it was\nable to get out of the build trap and remain out.

These were the exact words that popped out of the mouth of a CEO when I\nintroduced this concept to him. This issue is probably the most readily recognizable of the gaps.\n\nWe also saw this gap surface with the CTO of Marquetly. He demanded that\nwe lay out every single detail of a not-yet-validated product so that he could feel\nmore certain about what we were doing. A deluge of information isn’t always that\nhelpful for upper management. You need to focus on communicating and asking\nfor just enough information to make a decision.\n\nInstead of seeking more detailed information, upper management should be\nlimiting its direction to defining and communicating the strategic intent, or the\ngoals of the business. The strategic intents combine to communicate where the\ncompany is heading and what it desires to achieve when it gets there. The strategic intent points the team toward the outcomes the businesses wants to achieve.\n\nIn the case with Marquetly, there were too many unknowns at the time to\nmake a detailed plan. It still did not understand why users were falling off at certain steps of the sign-up flow. This was the core problem it needed to understand\nbefore coming up with the right solution. The company needed room to experiment and to understand why before it could suggest how to solve the problem.\n\nConsider a product manager telling you the following: “I’m building this\nbecause it’s going to help increase acquisitions, and new customer-acquisition is\nour big goal to drive the revenue prioritized at the corporate level. I know my\nproduct can bring people in. We know there’s a problem here, but we’re not sure\nwhat it is yet. Our next step is to discover that problem, tackle it with a solution,\nand then try to optimize the solution so we can increase acquisition.” That’s\nsomeone telling the story.

Instead of aligning a team with a framework of goals and direction and then stepping back to\ngive that team the room to explore how to reach the goals, management usually\nswings a complete 180 degrees. It asks for more information. It expects teams to\ncommit to what management wants to do over the next year.

Those companies that are busy creating new visions\nand strategies every year often are thinking too much in the short term and aren’t\nplanning enough for the future.\n\nMaybe you recognize this pattern. It’s the same story every year. In November, the company goes into panic mode, running around like chickens with their\nheads cut off, trying to predict the future for the next year. Revenue, commitments to shareholders, and budgets all get set. The laundry list of features that\nneed to be built piles up into detailed Gantt charts. And then January 1 hits, and\nthey get to work. They work on these things for a year, reach the arbitrary deadline of December 31, and then stop to adopt their next strategy. Repeat this year\nafter year, and you leave no room to take on long-term projects or strategies.\n\nTying budgeting, strategy, and product development to this artificial yearly\ntime cycle only creates lack of focus and follow-through. Instead, companies\nshould be continuously evaluating where they are and where they need to take\naction, and then fund those decisions.\n\nThink of the major pieces of work you do that are actually bets. Henrik Kniberg, a former consultant at Spotify, explains that this is how Spotify thinks.1 The\ncompany operates using something called DIBBs, which stands for Data,\nInsights, Beliefs, and Bets. The first three things, data, insight, and beliefs,\ninform a piece of work called a bet. The concept of thinking of initiatives as bets\nis powerful because it sets up a different type of expectation.\n\nSpotify maintains innovation by not establishing mandates about what to\nbuild from a higher-up perspective. Managers give employees the leeway to participate in hackathons and to implement their ideas. They set up an environment\nin which it’s safe to try new things and fail. Upper management is willing to\nembrace uncertainty about what customers want, and, by doing so, they create a\nwork environment that embraces experimentation and innovation and that can\ncourse-correct quickly, when necessary.\n\nWhen strategy is communicated well in an organization, product development and management are synchronized. The company strategy informs the\nactivities of the product development teams, and the execution of work on the\nproducts and data this produces informs the company direction. This should be a\ncyclical process throughout the organization, in which information is being communicated up, down, and across, to ensure alignment and understanding.\n\n1 Henrik Kniberg, “Spotify Rhythm,” talk at Agile Sverige, June 2016. http://bit.ly/2qhTPL9.", "source_file": "Escaping_the_build_trap_-_Melissa_Perri.pdf", "extraction_method": "pdfminer", "ocr_used": false, "has_table": false, "l1_summary": "It’s the same story every year.

We call this\nact of communicating and aligning those narratives strategy deployment.\n\nJabe Bloom, the founder of consulting firm PraxisFlow, works with executives to create and deploy strategies at large organizations. He explains why we\nshould think about different levels of strategies as stories at different time scales:\n\nAt different levels of organizations, we tell stories with different scales of\ntime (timespans), about our work and why we are doing it. In order for\npeople to act on the stories they hear, the stories can’t have significantly\ndifferent time scales than they are accustomed to. Agile teams are really\ngood at telling two- to four-week stories. That’s what they deal with on a\ndaily basis. As you go up in the organization, you tell stories with longer\ntimespans. Executives are really good at telling five-year stories, but a\nteam cannot act on a five-year story when they’re used to thinking in two\nto four weeks. There’s too much space to explore.\n\nStrategy deployment is about setting the right level of goals and objectives\nthroughout the organization to narrow the playing field so that teams can act. So,\nwhile executives might be looking at a five-year strategy, middle management is\nthinking in smaller strategies---yearly or quarterly---bounding the teams in a\ndirection that allows them to make decisions on a monthly or weekly basis.\n\nWhen teams are not sufficiently constrained, they become stuck. As Bloom\n\nexplains:\n\nThe unconstrained team is the most frightened and scared to act in the\norganization. They feel like they cannot make a decision because there are\ntoo many options. Appropriately constrained teams, ones who have a\ndirection set to the right level for them, feel safe to make decisions\nbecause they can see how their stories align to the goals and structure of\nthe organization.\n\nNot having the right level of direction lands us in the build trap.

Its strategic intents mostly fell\ninto that category, since they had to grow quickly from $50 million in revenue to\n$150 million in the next few years in order to IPO. This was the kind of return its\ninvestors were looking for. The company analyzed what it was currently doing\nand how much it thought it could gain by focusing the organization around areas\nfor revenue growth.\n\nMarquetly realized that, in order to grow its revenue to the numbers it\nneeded, it should focus on expanding upmarket, selling to larger companies\n(enterprises), which currently made up a small portion of its revenue. This would\nallow Marquetly to sell licenses in bulk, producing more revenue and fostering\ngreater retention, as the few enterprises that already used Marquetly’s product\ntended to renew annually. The company also realized that, to reach its revenue\ngoals, it would need to increase the revenue from individual users, as well. At\nthat point, its acquisition rates were not great. Management set these as the company’s two strategic intents and associated the appropriate revenue goals around\nthem, as illustrated in Table 13-1.\n\nTable 13-1.

With 5,000 people, they shipped only one feature per quarter\nbecause everyone was wildly distracted and working on too many things. One\nintent is usually good for a small company, and three are plenty for a large organization. Yes, three.

The product vision and portfolio vision keep you anchored\nin the problems and solutions that you want to explore.\n\nProduct Vision\n\nIn the past two years, I have met with more than a dozen companies that have\nhad trouble aligning around a product vision. They built products for the past decade and have reached a point at which they can no longer scale. All of them have\nthe same problem: too many products and no coherent vision. They were building one-off products to satisfy individual customer requests, but they failed to\naddress a wider audience. Or they built products that helped them move into new\nmarkets but did not figure out how these new products reconciled with their\nexisting offerings. Many of these companies are ridiculously successful---they\nmake over a billion dollars a year---but they are bogged down with too many people, little direction, and no holistic approach, making it difficult to keep growing.\nAlthough having a strategy usually helps these companies align and focus\ntheir work, it also reveals a bigger issue: the lack of an overall product vision.\nEven though having multiple features and ways to deliver value is a good thing,\nwe need something to tie it all together at the top.\n\nThe product vision communicates why you are building something and what\nthe value proposition is for the customer. Amazon does this particularly well by\ncreating what they call Press Release documents for every product vision. These\nshort (typically a page or two) notices describe the problem the user is facing and\nhow the solution enables the user to solve that problem.\n\nThe product vision emerges from experimentation around solving problems\nfor users. After you validate that the solution is the right one, you can grow it into\na scalable, maintainable product. But you need to be careful not to make the\nproduct vision too specific. It cannot describe every little feature but should\ninclude more of the main capabilities it enables for the user. If you are too prescriptive, it could stifle the way you grow the product and what you might add to\nit later.\n\nAt Marquetly, the company was formulating the product vision for their\nproducts.

How do we figure out what is stopping\nthem?

I can easily\nadd this to the site in about 10 minutes.”\n\n“That is awesome,” said Monica. “Let’s do it and see what we get.”\nThe team put the Qualaroo widget on its site. Within a week, it had more\n\nthan a hundred responses.\n\n“It’s amazing, we learned so much,” said Monica. “And no one said they\nwere leaving because of free trials!” It turned out that about 55% of the people\nsaid they were leaving because they couldn’t find enough classes in new types of\nmarketing methods, like social media. Another 25% said they were looking for\nsomething that could help them get into marketing as a career transition, but\nthey didn’t see how these classes proved they gained any skills.\n\n“We do the assessment at the beginning when they sign up, but we never\nreassess them to show they’ve mastered any skills,” said Monica.

To do this, you need to understand the strategic intent, evaluate the current state of that strategic intent in relation to where your products can help, and determine what problems you can\nsolve to further that strategic intent. This is what Marquetly did during its\nresearch and analysis to arrive at the product initiatives of increasing content and\nbuilding out a more robust assessment.\n\nThere can be many options that help reach the product initiative, as we saw\nwith the three we had to produce more content at Marquetly. One or all of these\nmight be what it takes to get us to the successful outcome of the initiative, and\nthat’s okay. To determine whether we are getting closer to achieving our product\ninitiative, we need to break the success metrics into something we can measure\non a shorter time scale. We call this the team goal, and it’s how we measure the\nsuccess of the option. Although it can take six months or longer to reach the\nproduct initiative goal, the team goal should be something we can measure after\nevery release, which gives us feedback that our option is working the way we\nwant it to. We set the team goal with the same process as we did for the product\ninitiative.\n\nContext Matters\n\nSince Lean Startup emerged on the scene, experimentation has been a hot button\ntopic in many software companies. I see teams readily jump into experimenting,\nexciting to kick off that A/B test or to prototype something. It’s important to take\na step back and understand where you are and what is needed in that stage\nbefore you jump into any work. This is where the Product Kata helps.\n\nAfter we have set the goal, we begin walking through the Product Kata. We\n\nask ourselves the following:\n\n1. What is the goal?\n\n2. Where are we now in relation to that goal?\n\n3. What is the biggest problem or obstacle standing in the way of me reaching that goal?\n\n4. How do I try to solve that problem?\n\n5.

Then we reflect on that work in questions five and six and determine whether to go back to the beginning for the next round. These questions\ntake us through the problem exploration, solution exploration, and solution optimization phases. The steps we choose to take and the tools we implement to do\nso will change, depending on where we are.\n\nIt’s important to understand each phase so that we are doing just enough to\nget us to the goal. One of the biggest mistakes I’ve seen in product management\nis teams rushing in to apply a tool or practice at the wrong stage. Many times,\nthey are experimenting unnecessarily when the problem is not yet known or\nwhen there is already a good idea about the solution.\n\nWhen considering whether to experiment around a particular solution, I\nthink of what my friend Brian Kalma, former head of UX for Zappos, once told\nme: “Don’t spend your time overdesigning and creating unique, innovative solutions for things that are not core to your value proposition. If someone has\nalready solved that problem with a best practice, learn from that, implement their\nsolutions, gather data to determine if it’s successful in your situation, and then\niterate. Reserve your time and energy for the things that will make or break your\nvalue proposition.”\n\nA good example of this is a checkout page on an e-commerce website. If you\ndon’t want to get into the business of being a checkout service for other ecommerce companies, don’t spend all your time here. There’s lots of experimentation that has already happened around this particular solution, and you can\nharness that. I should know. I researched this heavily when I worked at an when\nI worked at an e-commerce company. If you can, learn from those who have optimized already, implement their best practices, and tweak from there. When\nthat’s not an option, you have a chance to explore adjacent areas or to chart your\nown path.\n\nWhen the problem that you are solving is core to your value proposition, take\na step back and don’t rush into the first solution. Use your unique context to set\nyou apart from competitors. Experiment with a few solution ideas before committing to one.\n\nWith this approach to product management, all design and development\nwork is in service to reaching a goal. It doesn’t mean that all of the things you try\nwill be shipped. Hopefully, many of them won’t be. The best thing you can do, at\nthis point, is kill the bad ideas! The fewer features, the better.

What percentage of them, roughly, do we\nthink want that?” I asked them.\n\n“Well,” Karen said, “we have two points of data we can pull from to approximate that. We left Qualaroo running on our site for about a month, and we’re\nfinding that, of the people who answered, about 55% of them said they were looking for more course variety.

Then she explained what they already knew:\n\n“When we did the initial research, we found that a lot of the students were\ninterested in learning new marketing methods. These were things like harnessing social media and content creation to drive traffic to the site. So it’s not\nenough just to increase content---we have to be strategic about it.

Acquisition is that users land on your site\nand sign up. This is what they were measuring at Marquetly. Activation is when\nsomeone takes the first step with your product toward having a great experience.\nFor Marquetly, that would be taking the assessment so that they understand\nwhich courses to take. Activating people well at the beginning leads to retention\ndown the line.\n\nNow not every company has the same path to monetizing users. This path\nworks for consumer products with a freemium attribute. If you are a B2B product\nwith a sales team, you generate revenue before users have activation. You can\nswap the order of these to match your product’s flow.\n\nWith the right funnel, you can easily calculate the conversion through each\nstep. This informs you as to where people are tending to fall off and allows you to\nact to fix it. Understanding how many people are in each phase of the funnel also\nlets you target those cohorts and figure out how to move them into the next one.\nThe goal here is to keep people retained and paying.\n\nAlthough Pirate Metrics became very popular, some people saw the flaw that\nit did not talk about user satisfaction. Kerry Rodden, a Googler, created the\nHEART metrics to account for this.\n\nThe HEART Framework\n\nHEART metrics measure happiness, engagement, adoption, retention, and task success. These are usually used to talk about a specific product or feature. Here,\nadoption is similar to activation in Pirate Metrics because you are talking about\nsomeone using the product for the first time. Retention is the same as in Pirate\nMetrics.\n\nWith HEART, you add in other metrics to talk about how the user interacts\nwith the product. Happiness is a measure of how satisfied the user is with the\nproduct. Engagement is a measure of how often users interact with the product.\nTask success measures how easy it is for a user to accomplish what they were\nmeant to with the product.\n\nYou can learn more about HEART metrics in Rodden’s article, “How to\n\nChoose the Right UX Metrics for Your Product.”1\n\n1 Kerry Rodden, “How to choose the right UX metrics for your product,” Medium.com. http://bit.ly/\n\n2D77HAi.", "source_file": "Escaping_the_build_trap_-_Melissa_Perri.pdf", "extraction_method": "pdfminer", "ocr_used": false, "has_table": false, "l1_summary": "With HEART, you add in other metrics to talk about how the user interacts\nwith the product.

This is how we connect product metrics to\nbusiness outcomes. But it’s important to have metrics at every level of strategy,\nincluding the product initiative and option, so we can tell whether we are successful along the way.\n\nWhatever your metric, it’s important to have a system of metrics, not just\none, to guide product decisions. It’s easy to game one metric when it’s your singular focus. Marquetly could have easily fallen into this trap, as well. Whatever\noptions it explores to increase acquisition, it should be sure to keep watching the\nretention rate of those users and should make sure it doesn’t fall below a certain\nthreshold. I call the system of two metrics that balance out each other mutually\ndestructive pairs, although there can be more than just two.\n\nThere is one issue with this system, though. Retention is a lagging indicator,\nwhich is impossible to act on immediately. It will be months before you have\nsolid data to show that people stayed with you. That is why we also need to measure leading indicators like activation, happiness, and engagement. Leading indicators tell us whether we’re on our way to achieving those lagging indicators like\nretention. To determine the leading indicators for retention, you can qualify what\nkeeps people retained---for example, happiness and usage of the product.\n\nUsually, the success metrics we set around options are leading indicators of\noutcomes we expect on our initiatives, because options are strategies on a shorter\ntime scale, as we talked about in the previous chapter. The success metrics need\nto be commensurate with the length of the bet there. Measuring the metrics at\nyour option level helps to prevent surprises when the cold, hard facts come in\nlater at the initiative level.\n\nTo make sure you have enough data to act on, it’s important to implement\ntools that make it easy to measure these things. This is one of the first things\nevery company should do---implement a metrics platform. Amplitude, Pendo.io,\nMixpanel, Intercom, and Google Analytics are all data platforms. Some, like like\nIntercom and Pendo.io, also implement good customer feedback loops, because\nthey provide tools to reach out to customers and ask questions. Having a metrics\nplatform implemented, whether it’s homegrown or third party, is essential for a\nproduct-led company because it enables product managers to make wellinformed decisions.\n\nWhen setting goals, it’s important to be realistic.

Because it involves talking to (gasp) people. It takes a lot of effort to line up\nthe interviews, and sometimes that can seem more daunting than staying inside\nand jumping right into A/B testing or sifting through data.

For\nthe first and third use case, we might create a UI with which they can choose certain metrics to monitor and have them update over a time period.

It was a\ndistraction.\n\nMy friend Josh Wexler says, “Nobody wants to hear that their baby is ugly.”\nThe way around this is to not get too attached.

I got to work trying to assess where they were in the\nprocess and which problem they were solving. Where did this idea for an app\ncome from? After some digging and talking to key people, I discovered that the\ncompany had launched an entirely different app the year before and had a very\nsuccessful download rate. More people were coming to the site, and it really was\na boon for acquisition.\n\nThe company was convinced it would get a lot of customer business from\nthis new app, as well, but no one was able to determine whether the problem\nthey were solving was the right one. The company had rushed into building features for the sake of getting something out the door rather than trying to understand what its customers wanted and needed.\n\nOn my first day, I met with the product and leadership teams to dig deeper\ninto their idea for the new app. This time around, they wanted to use a Tinderlike interface to match women up with potential business mentors. The hypothesis was that women needed access to mentors quickly to help with career advice\nand advancement, and they were willing to connect with other women in their\ncities to meet that need. The teams put a lot of weight in that hypothesis. But we\ndecided to take a step back and ask the glaring question: “Do women feel comfortable connecting with strangers for mentorship in this manner?”\n\nWe tested that assumption. We interviewed many women and pitched the\napp idea to those who were struggling to find a mentor. The reaction was not\ngreat. “Eww, no,” was the typical response. These women didn’t want strangers\nas mentors. They had to discuss intimate details of their work relationship, and\nthey felt they needed something in common before they could build a relationship.

They didn’t want to swipe to find a mentor.\n\nThrough this process, the company learned what the customers wanted, as\nwell as what they didn’t want, and that process was revealing. They quickly realized that it wasn’t actually building the right thing for its customers. The solution\nhad been invalidated, but they still did not understand whether they were solving\nthe right problem. Following this revelation, I worked with the team to begin\nlooking in more depth at a few of these women’s problems around mentorship\nand business networking, by doing proper problem research through interviews.\nAfter this experience, the team was able to see that, if it tested the hypothesis\nearly, through research and more experiments, it could save a lot of money in the\nfuture. The team was already paying a product developer a ton of money to start\ncreating the app, when it could have used a different approach to prove or disprove its desirability in a week.

In these situations, you need to get creative. A friend of mine, Chris Matts, is a master of navigating company constraints. He once told me about how he was working at a company and was told\nhe could not talk to the customers. He went to the person who set the rule, who\nthen sent him to another person who had apparently set the rule. He kept going\nup and up the chain until finally getting to the person who really had issued the\nedict. This person looked at him and said, “What? I never said people couldn’t\ntalk to those customers. I just said you had to go through a specific process to do\nit. Just fill out this form.” The next day, he was talking to customers.\n\nLearning some information is better than none. In a consumer industry, you\ncan usually reach out to friends of friends who use the product or have the right\nbackground. In a B2B environment, you can work with the sales or account managers to have them be your research spies---asking the questions you might need\nto know during their sales calls or follow-up meetings. It’s not always possible,\nbut in many places, when you think outside the box, you can come up with something that helps.

It can be tricky because, as you might have experienced\nalready, people often immediately jump into telling you the solution. “Oh, I just\nneed a button here that lets me do X,” they say. As a product manager, you need\nto back up and ask, “Okay, but why? Why do you need a button? Why do you\nthink a button is the right thing? What are you trying to accomplish?” It is understanding the user’s need---not the button---that helps you to get closer to understanding the root of the problem.\n\nRemember, it’s not the customer’s job to solve their own problems. It’s your\n\njob to ask them the right questions.\n\nValidating the Problem\n\nBack at Marquetly, Christa and her team were getting a real-life lesson in problem validation.\n\n“So we’re betting that, if we make it painless and quick to get content into\nthe system, we can increase the number of published courses. What if we just\nautomated the creation of the course? They could easily upload all their content\nsomewhere, and we could just take care of putting into the right place,” Christa\nproposed.\n\n“Hmm, that could be interesting, but I think there’s a bunch of nuances with\nit,” said Rich. “For example, are the things they are entering all standardized?\nThere would be so many different fields, and every course isn’t technically the\nsame. We wouldn’t be able to do that unless they followed a specific format for\nthe course---like if everyone had a video, caption, block of text, etc. I’m a bit skeptical.”\n\nChrista thought about it for a moment. “I think you’re right, but I just don’t\nknow. Maybe they want more control over the content, maybe they don’t,” she\nsaid. “Why don’t we run a small test to see whether we understand if they want to\ncustomize their types of content or if they were okay following a certain format?\nMaybe they are experts on course design and are particular about it, or maybe\nthey’re looking to us for guidance.”\n\nI was sitting there observing.

This is why experimenting to learn was key.\n\nCompanies often confuse the building to learn and building to earn. Experimentation is all about building to learn. It allows you to understand your customers better and to prove whether there is value in solving a problem. Experiments\nshould not be designed to last for a long time. By nature, they are meant to prove\nwhether a hypothesis is true or false, and, in software, we want to do this as\nquickly as possible. This means you’ll need to eventually scrap whatever you\nbuild and figure out how to make it sustainable and scalable, if it does succeed.\n\nSince The Lean Startup was published, companies have been adopting experimentation techniques, yet many of them have done so for the wrong reasons.\nThey all are trying to build the ideal Minimum Viable Product (MVP), an experimentation concept introduced in the book. I asked my Twitter followers how they\ndefined an MVP at their company. A bunch of people replied, but one follower\nsummed it up well: “I was told by two separate clients that whatever is built in\nthe first release is an MVP.”\n\nThis type of thinking is exactly what lands us in the build trap. When we use\nan MVP only to get a feature out quicker, we’re usually cutting corners on a great\nexperience in the process. Thus, we sacrifice the amount we can learn from it.\nThe most important piece of the MVP is the learning, which is why my definition\nhas always been “the minimum amount of effort to learn.” This keeps us anchored on outcomes rather than outputs.\n\nDue to the misconception of this term, I have stopped using MVP altogether.\nInstead, I talk more about solution experimentation. These experiments are\ndesigned to help companies learn faster. Here we are experimenting to learn, not\nbuilding to earn. We are not creating stable, robust, and scalable products. Often,\nwe don’t know what the best solution would even be when we begin experimenting. That is the point in doing this work.\n\nThe Product Kata is a great tool for grounding people in learning. It always\nasks the question, “What do you need to learn next?” This keeps the team on\ntrack and sets it up to create the right type of experiments.\n\nThere are many ways to experiment to learn. Concierge, Wizard of Oz, and\nconcept testing are three examples of solution experiments, each of which I\nexplain shortly.\n\nBecause these are not designed to be long-lasting solutions, you want to limit\nexposure to your customers.

Communication is key to a successful\nexperimentation process.\n\nCONCIERGE\n\nThe experiment that Marquetly ran with its teachers is called a concierge experiment. Concierge experiments deliver the end result to your client manually, but\nthey do not look like the final solution at all. Your customers will understand that\nyou’re doing it manually and that it’s not automated. It’s one of my favorite\nexperiment types because it doesn’t involve coding and it’s quick to get started.\nBecause you get to work with your customers closely, there is a ton of feedback\nflowing through and there are tight learning loops.\n\nConcierge experiments are particularly interesting for B2B companies\nbecause this is how many of these companies got started---by taking on the work\nfor the customers and then later automating it. By taking on the work yourself,\nyou can learn how to build the software correctly the first time. And it’s far faster\nand less expensive to iterate on a service than on a coded feature. I frequently\nused this type of experiment to learn about my customers when I worked as a\nproduct manager.\n\nAt an SEO company, we used Excel to model a forecasting tool to predict\nwhere organizations’ keywords would rank. We were able to deliver the spreadsheet manually to a few clients and gauge their response. We learned what types\nof factors they were most interested in controlling and what percentage of certainty made them feel comfortable. After a month of using spreadsheets, we were\nable to code the feature into our product and to launch to our user base with wide\nsuccess.\n\nConcierge experimenting can be a very powerful tool. The thing to note with\nthis method is that it does not scale, given that it’s labor intensive. You should\nconduct these experiments with just enough users so that you can stay in regular\ncontact with them, get plenty of feedback, and then use that information to iterate. As Marquetly did, you can calculate how many people you can handle over a\ncertain period of time. When you are ready to see whether your solution scales to\nmore people, you should use another type of experiment.\n\nWIZARD OF OZ\n\nThe method I suggest for reaching a broader audience for feedback is called the\nWizard of Oz.

Customers don’t know\nthat, on the backend, it’s all manual. Someone is pulling the strings---just like\nthe Wizard of Oz.\n\nZappos actually started with this Wizard of Oz method. Back in the day,\nfounder Nick Swinmurn wanted to see whether people would really buy shoes\nonline. He put a simple website up on WordPress. Visitors could view and then\nbuy the shoes online. But, on the backend, it was just Nick, singlehandedly running around, buying shoes from Sears and shipping them out from UPS himself, as each order came in. There was no infrastructure, no inventory of shoes,\nno person manning the phones. It was simply a page where the founder waited\nfor orders. As soon as the orders came in, he went and fulfilled them. Through\nthis approach, he validated that there was demand for buying shoes online\nwithout building out the entire site. That’s the Wizard of Oz method.\n\nThis is a great technique, when you are looking for feedback at scale. We\nused this to prove a hypothesis around subscriptions at an e-commerce company\nwhere I worked. The head of operations had a great idea on how to sell more of\nour existing products. This was right around the time when Amazon implemented its one-click subscription services, and he saw that it could apply to us, as\nwell. We had many products on our site that required people to reorder them\nevery month---protein powder, vitamins, and supplements, for example.\n\nHe came to me with the idea and asked us to explore how much effort it\nwould be to implement. Unfortunately, our third-party shipping management\nsystem did not support subscription-based products, and it would have been a\nsignificant development haul. We calculated out roughly how much it would cost\nto do it completely and designed a Wizard of Oz experiment to see whether the\nsubscriptions would bring in enough revenue to justify the effort.\n\nWe then ended up just duplicating every product that qualified for a subscription, renamed it with “subscription” attached to the title, and added in a\nsimple PDF agreement at checkout. It looked like a normal subscription product\nto the customers, but, on the back end, the customer service team would pull the\norders on those products and reorder it for people every month. We kept track of\nthose sales for four months and found that many people would cancel their subscriptions in the second or third month. That was strange. I mean, if they wanted\nto keep using the product, they would need to reorder it.\n\nI called some of the people to find out.

And,\nbecause we experimented first, we ended up saving over a $100,000 of development costs.\n\nCompanies are tempted to leave Wizard of Oz experiments up for a long\ntime because they look real to the customers. This is not wise, because it is still\nmanual on the backend. After you know which direction you want to go in, you\ncan begin to think about the full solution or move on to other forms of experimentation.\n\nWizard of Oz can also be combined with techniques such as A/B testing. In\nA/B testing, you split a portion of your traffic to a new solution idea to see\nwhether it moves a metric compared to the current state of the site. You can use\nthis outside of Wizard of Oz, as well, to test new designs or messages on your\nwebsite.\n\nBut you need to be careful about when you use A/B testing. You wouldn’t\nwant to use A/B testing in two instances: if you were still very unsure about your\nsolution direction or if you did not have enough traffic to those pages for the\nresults to have statistical significance. If the latter, you could use techniques like\nconcept testing to get feedback.\n\nCONCEPT TESTING\n\nConcept testing is another solution experiment that focuses more on high-touch\ninteraction with the customer. In this case, you try to demonstrate or show concepts to the user to gauge their feedback. These can vary in execution, from landing pages and low-fidelity wireframes to higher-fidelity prototypes or videos of\nhow the service might play out. The idea here is to pitch the solution idea in the\nfastest, lightest way possible to convey the message.\n\nIt’s important to note that this type of experiment tends to be more generative than evaluative. Just like problem research, generative solution experiments\nhelp you to gain more awareness around what a user desires in a solution. When\nyou show the concept to users, you are asking them to put themselves into the\nscenario in which they are experiencing the problem, and you are asking them\nquestions about how the solution would or would not solve their problem.\n\nIf you want to make it evaluative, to firmly test a hypothesis, you need a\ndefinitive pass-or-fail criteria, when interviewing a customer about the concept.\nThis can be what I call an ask---something you would need from the user, either\nin the form of a commitment, monetary value, time, or some other investment", "source_file": "Escaping_the_build_trap_-_Melissa_Perri.pdf", "extraction_method": "pdfminer", "ocr_used": false, "has_table": false, "l1_summary": "Wizard of Oz can also be combined with techniques such as A/B testing.

This is how Dropbox got its first round of investment.1 When starting\nout, Dropbox had the hunch that the biggest issue it could solve for users was\nseamless synchronization of their documents across computers and the internet.\nThe issue was definitely rampant, but the company had a difficult time pitching\nthe solution to investors. When it explained how Dropbox worked, the investors\ndismissed it, citing a crowded market of similar tools. No matter how hard they\ntried to explain the solution, the investors just couldn’t picture it.\n\nSo, the company turned to a solution experiment. The team put together a\nrough video, demonstrating what Dropbox could do. It had not built a demo or a\nprototype but instead used video editing to demonstrate what it would look and\nfeel like to the investors. It felt like a real product demo, even though it wasn’t a\nfinished product. When the investors saw it, they went wild. To them, it was\nmagic. Dropbox was able to secure it funding and to validate that it was on the\nright path.\n\nWhen You Don’t Need to Experiment Robustly\n\nAt a workshop recently, a product manager asked me, “Do we always need to run\nthese experiments? What if it’s an easy problem to fix?” The answer is no.\nAlthough concierge, Wizard of Oz, and concept testing are all good techniques,\nsometimes you don’t need to experiment so heavily around multiple concepts. It\nis important to remember that these tools are used for higher amounts of uncertainty and, thus, larger risk in your solution ideas.\n\nFor example, I worked with one team that was experimenting around how to\nreduce the amount of calls to a help desk at its office. The team found an issue\nwhere an expected button was not being displayed on the screen. Being excellent\nstudents of this methodology, they wanted to deploy an A/B test, displaying the\nbutton for half of the participants and measuring the change. I told the team that\nwasn’t the right approach. In this case, the team knew the problem and the solution. It was time to implement it. There was no need for up-front testing, but\nthey should still be measuring whether it reduces calls after the implementation.\n\n1 “How DropBox Started as a Minimal Viable Product,” TechCrunch. https://tcrn.ch/2PnoIfp.", "source_file": "Escaping_the_build_trap_-_Melissa_Perri.pdf", "extraction_method": "pdfminer", "ocr_used": false, "has_table": false, "l1_summary": "So, the company turned to a solution experiment.

In this\ncase, you should still be building to learn instead of rushing into a complete solution, but there are other tools you can harness, such as prototypes.\n\nPrototypes are the most popular tool for testing. When you need to learn\nwhether a specific user flow or feature solves a problem for the user and allows\nthem to achieve their desired outcome, you can turn to prototypes. It is an excellent tool because prototypes don’t require any code, and there are many software\nproducts out there that can help you link screens together to make the flow feel\nreal.\n\nBut, if you don’t go the design sprint route when creating your prototype,\nwhich includes heavy user research before diving into design, you can easily\nbecome stuck trying to solve a problem you don’t yet understand. Prototypes\ndon’t make sense when you need to validate the problem. In this case, you’re\nspinning your wheels creating shiny designs that look great but don’t help you to\nlearn what you need to learn. That’s why you need to focus on exploring the problem before any solution activities.\n\nIt’s important to remember that any experiment type must be used appropriately and in the right context. That said, you also can and should use your own\ncreativity to come up with different types of experiments to help clarify the questions you need to answer before you converge on the solution idea. Get creative!\nJust remember that your biggest objective in this phase is to learn---not to earn.\n\nExperimenting in Complex Industries\n\nWhen I introduce the concept of experimenting to learn, I am frequently met by\nthe same response: “That sounds nice, but we just can’t do that here.” That’s just\nwrong.\n\nOf course, not every industry can take advantage of landing pages or Wizard\nof Oz, because they are best suited for consumer products. But these are only two\ntypes of experiments. If a good experiment helps you learn, you can always find a\nway within your constraints. Making known the unknown reduces risk, and that\ngoes for large, bureaucratic companies like banks, as well as for industries with\nlong product development timelines, like aviation. There is no excuse for not\nlearning.\n\nEven the most seemingly Waterfall projects can be experimental. Consider\ndeveloping a space shuttle.

You hypothesize, test, and then iterate to find the right\nmaterial combination. After it is known, it gets built as a component of the space\nshuttle. This is how we should be approaching products in any industry.\n\nIn 2014, I advised a company in London called GiveVision, while I was mentoring startups at the Wayra accelerator. The GiveVision mission was to help\nsight-impaired people “see” by providing glasses that would read, recognize, and\nreport on what was going on in the world around them. After I got over my feelings of, “These people are literally saving the world. What the hell am I doing\nwith my life?” we sat down to talk about the company’s product development process. I learned that the development timeline for its glasses would be on the\norder of years. The organization had to program the software with a third-party\nmanufacturer and couldn’t iterate on it afterward because it was hardcoded into\nthe glasses and couldn’t be updated after it was installed. I talked to founders\nabout the concept of risk and how the company might mitigate it with experimentation. The founder said that the biggest risk was that there were so many\noptions for what could be programmed into the glasses and no one was sure\nwhich ones were the highest value items. That’s when the company decided to\nexperiment.\n\nWhen I came back a month later, I was astounded by the progress the group\nhad made. To learn what its potential users cared about the most, the company\nhad done a few things. First, it did a lot research which included following and\nobserving how sight-impaired people go about their day. Team members learned\nabout their customers’ biggest frustrations, how they might position themselves\naround certain obstacles, and what type of information they were seeking.\n\nOne woman said, “Every day I have to take a certain bus to work, but I can\nnever tell which bus is approaching the stop, so I need to flag down all of them.\nWhen I get on, I ask the driver but immediately get off when I know it’s the\nwrong one. As I’m leaving the bus, I can hear everyone sighing that I held them\nup. I wish I could read the route number of the bus as it approaches.”\n\nStories like this piled up. GiveVision used these anecdotes and observations\nto identify the most important problems it could solve. The priority became reading signs (like the one identifying the bus number), nutritional information, currency, and colors.\n\nThe next question to answer was, “Can we make the software recognize and\nreport in a way that satisfies the user?” This is where it got tricky.

We could build software\nthat does video editing ourselves. Or, lastly, we can buy a video-editing technology that is user-friendly and embed it into our teacher platform. The last one is\nthe best, margin-wise, but there is risk that the teachers won’t be able to use it.

In\nthe meantime, we could figure out a partnership to help people in the shorter\nterm,” Karen finished.\n\n“What are the risks to doing this?” asked the CFO.\n“We have eliminated most of the risks,” said Karen. “By experimenting first,\nwe were able to determine that the teachers will do video editing on their own if\ngiven the right tools, like this software from Budapest, and they will actually publish their courses.

They then prioritized the work, cutting out\na few less-critical components in the first version.\n\n“Okay, it looks like we have our work for the first version,” said Rich. “With\nthe work we’ve done to integrate the systems, we should be able to get this out in\na month.”\n\n“Yes, and I’ve been calculating success criteria on this first version.

They iterated\nalong the way, until the day came for the first release.\n\nFeeling confident, the team launched its new video-editing capabilities to the\nteachers and waited to see how they were received. Within one week, they could\nsee the adoption of the features begin to increase. They reached out to the teachers periodically to see how they were receiving the new capabilities. There were a\nfew issues that they prioritized in the next release, but things seemed to be going\nsmoothly.\n\nAfter a month, Christa pulled the numbers to compare to the team’s success\nmetrics. “Our adoption rate isn’t quite where we need it to be,” she told the team.\n“We only had 60% of the teachers adopt the video-editing software in that first\nmonth. The ones who did adopt it are surpassing our previous published course\nrate with a 75% publish rate. We need to figure out what is standing in the teachers’ way of taking us up on it.

I’m just\n\nalways looking for that problem and what I need to learn.”\n\n“That’s exactly what it’s designed to do,” I smiled. “I’m so excited to see how\n\nfar this team has come. Keep doing what you’re doing.”\n\nThe team worked to keep iterating on its new video-editing functionality\nuntil it reached its goals. After a few months, the results were speaking for themselves. A 75% publish rate, happier teachers, and an increased number of published second courses all spoke to the success.\n\nEvolving the Product Vision\n\nChrista’s team was able to find a scalable, successful solution by iterating its way\nto a product vision. As I mentioned in the strategy section, it evolved through\nexperimentation. Had the team jumped into dictating features early on, it might\nnever have found the right solution for its customers. The team probably would\nhave still been stuck on redesigning the course creation workflow, which it later\nproved was not the biggest problem.\n\nAfter the direction is set for the product vision, it’s important to make sure\neveryone understands the context and work that needs to be done. Story mapping\nand North Star documents are two ways to help teams find alignment around the\nvision.\n\nA North Star document explains the product in a way that can be visualized\nby the entire team and company. This includes the problem it is solving, the proposed solution, the solution factors that matter for success, and the outcomes the\nproduct will result in.\n\nNorth Stars are great for providing context to a wide audience. They should\nbe evolved over time, as you learn more about your product. It’s important to\nnote that this is not an action plan---it does not include how the team will be\nbuilding the product. That is where story mapping comes in.\n\nStory mapping helps teams break down their work and align around goals. As\nPatton says, “Its purpose is to help the team communicate about their work and\nwhat needs to get done to deliver value.” Christa’s team used story mapping to\nthink through all the factors needed to deliver a successful solution. This\nincluded breaking down each desired action from the user standpoint.\n\nBuilding understanding as a team helps you develop product faster, which\nmeans getting value out to the customers faster.

You need to always start at that big\npicture---the North Star---to do this well, though. Otherwise, there is nothing to\nanchor you, and you end up leading yourself into the build trap.\n\nPrioritizing Work\n\nTo get to a Version 1, you need to prioritize your work. Prioritization, as I mentioned earlier, is a top issue for most product managers. There are many frameworks out there that will help you prioritize, like benefits mapping, Kano models,\nand others, but my favorite is Cost of Delay. If you understand the desired outcomes from a strategic perspective, you can use Cost of Delay to help you determine what to ship sooner.\n\nIn his book, The Principles of Product Development Flow, Don Reinertsen talks\nabout the importance of Cost of Delay in prioritizing work. He calls it “the one\nthing” that should be quantified. Cost of Delay is a numeric value that describes\nthe impact of time on the outcomes you hope to achieve. It combines urgency\nand value so that you can measure impact and prioritize what you should be\ndoing first.\n\nWhen you think of building and releasing that first version of the product,\nyou need to consider the trade-offs between the amount of value you can capture\nwith the scope of the release and the time it takes to get it out the door. It’s an\noptimization problem. You want to reduce scope enough so that you can capture\nthe maximum value in the right time.\n\nIf you wait too long because you overscoped the release, you lose the money\nyou could have been making. Worse, a competitor could swoop in and steal your\nmarket. Then you’d have a higher threshold to entry, and your product will need\nto be light years better than the competition’s. On the flip side, you don’t want to\nrelease something that is terrible and provides minimal benefit to the user in\norder to get it out early. Then you could lose early adopters, and it’s difficult to\nwin someone back after they’ve had a terrible experience.\n\nChrista’s team discussed the Cost of Delay involved with shipping the thirdparty video feature in their first version. It decided that, because it wasn’t a critical component for a large number of users, and it would take another month to\ncode that part of the product, the product should not include it.

If you want to learn more, head to Black Swan Farming and\nread about how to utilize the concept in your company.\n\nIt’s important to remember that, after you ship the first version, though, you\nare not technically done. You still need to reach your goals. This is where the\nDefinition of Done comes into play.\n\nThe Real Definition of Done\n\nIn Agile development, there is a concept called the Definition of Done. It is\ndefined by the Scrum Alliance as a “checklist of valuable activities required to\nproduce software.”1 When teams create their Definition of Done, it’s usually\naround finishing building features required to ship a product. Although this is\ndefinitely a useful concept to make sure the team finished what it needs to, it sets\nthe wrong expectation about what a finished feature is.\n\nWe are done developing or iterating on a feature only when it has reached its\ngoals. Often, teams ship a first version of the feature and then move on to the\nnext, without measuring the outcomes for the user. As Jeff Gothelf, the author of\nSense & Respond, once said, “Version 2 is the biggest lie in software development.” This mentality always leads to the build trap.\n\nInstead, teams should be working like the team at Marquetly, by setting the\nsuccess criteria before launch, while measuring and iterating until they reach it.\nVersion 1 should be looked at as a hypothesis, just like any other work. And, if we\nlaunch the feature and it is not hitting our goals, we need to be comfortable rolling it back and trying something else.\n\nWhen you have success criteria set for the launch, you can use them in the\nProduct Kata and repeat the steps we went through in this section: set the direction with your success criteria, understand what problems are standing in the\nway of you reaching it, and systematically tackle them through experimentation.\n\nNo matter whether you are building a new feature or optimizing one, the\nprocess is the same. Problem exploration might be on a shorter time frame if it’s\naround a smaller feature than a new product. The same goes for solution experiments: they might not be as robust as the ones Marquetly was running. But no\nmatter what, you should always be diagnosing the problem and trying to understand how to solve it.\n\n1 Dhaval Panchal, “What is Definition of Done (DoD)?”, http://bit.ly/2Rjgh2i.", "source_file": "Escaping_the_build_trap_-_Melissa_Perri.pdf", "extraction_method": "pdfminer", "ocr_used": false, "has_table": false, "l1_summary": "This is where the\nDefinition of Done comes into play.

I didn’t know it at\nthe time, but this was a pattern I would see again and again over the next 10\nyears in many different companies.\n\nKodak made good strides in trying to innovate, but its organization prevented it from doing so. The company was reactive rather than strategic, waiting too\nlong to respond to a threat. By isolating a small team in an innovation lab, it also\ndidn’t dedicate enough people to thinking about the future of the business.\n\nEven though our team was practicing the discovery process of product management with the right approach, we were in a silo, separated out into an innovation center without the proper resources to fully execute on what we were\ndiscovering. Kodak had to secure a new budget to put any of our plans in action,\nsomething it couldn’t do for another six months during its annual review. Its philosophy as an organization was not set up to succeed in the world of rapid innovation that emerged during the early 2000s.\n\nMany companies are in danger of becoming just like Kodak, but this fate can\nbe avoided by adopting a product-led mindset.

Companies\nstruggle with roadmaps because they’ve created Gantt charts in the past, and\nthese charts basically say, “We’re going to deliver this feature by January 18, and\nwe’re going to deliver this feature by March 20.” A lot of roadmaps have been\npromised out to customers, and they’re locked into place and can’t be altered.\nThis gets you into trouble when you realize you have overpromised and underdelivered.\n\nInstead of thinking of roadmaps as a Gantt chart, you should view them as\nan explanation of strategy and the current stage of your product. This combines\nthe strategic goals with the themes of work and the emerging product deliverables from it. To do this, the product roadmap should be updated constantly, especially at the team levels. This is why, at Produx Labs, we call them Living\nRoadmaps.\n\nRoadmaps are not one-size-fits-all.

As I mentioned in the first section of the book, it’s dangerous to be a\nsales-led organization because it can lead to a lack of alignment around strategy.\nBut sales still needs something to sell. Creating working agreements and roadmaps that can be communicated to customers is key to developing a good relationship between product and sales. You can make an agreement with the sales\nteam that anything being released as GA---or anything further along in Beta---\ncan be added to its sales roadmap.\n\nGreat communication, in the form of working agreements, meeting cadences, and roadmaps, can solve many of the alignment problems in the company. It\ncan especially help move a company from being sales-led to product-led. But it\ntakes a lot of work to put all of this together. This is why you need a product operations team.\n\nProduct Operations\n\nWhen companies consist of just a handful of product teams, it is fairly easy to\nkeep track of what’s going on. Leaders can walk over to the product managers to\nlearn about progress on goals. Processes are usually determined at the team level.\nCoordination is not a large concern.\n\nBut, as product teams scale to more than a few teams, keeping track of progress, goals, and processes becomes a challenge. This was the frustration Chris\nwas explaining about not being able to see progress. Deploying the strategy and\ngoals, understanding success of experimentation, and reporting on progress was\ntoo much work for the product leaders of Marquetly alone. They needed to focus\non growing their product, and operations work was getting to be too much of a\ndistraction.\n\nTo help distribute the work, we ended up implementing a product operations team, run by a chief of staff who reported to the CPO. The chief of staff created a very small team (two people) to help her streamline operations and\nreporting. They oversaw the cadences of strategy, found an analytics partner to\nset up tracking, and collected and organized the progress toward goals into\nreports for executives. This allowed the product people to focus on what they\nwere good at, while product operations helped them to make informed decisions,\nby surfacing up those reports.\n\nIn larger organizations, you need the same thing, but at scale.

It\nalso means that people are afraid to try anything new. This mentality stifles innovation.

There may not be enough safety in the organization to fail and learn.\n\nMarquetly was successful because the CEO and leaders held back while the\nteams were experimenting, even if that made them squirm a bit.

The status quo is safe. The status quo keeps you from innovating.\n\nThis doesn’t mean that we should be failing in spectacular ways.

The CEO apologized, explained that the\nchoices it made were not core to its strategy, and stated that it was going to get\nback to its roots in satisfying customers through exceptional on-demand entertainment. The company picked itself back up and went along. And it never used\nthat experience to stifle innovation. Fast-forward a few years, and Netflix was creating their own TV shows, a huge experiment. This message was loud and clear\n---Netflix is a safe, innovative place that pushes the boundaries.\n\nMany companies talk about how they want their people to be innovative and\nhow they want to create crazy new products, but there has to be an understanding that it’s safe to fail in order to get innovation. When you don’t have safety\nbuilt in to your company, your product managers won’t feel comfortable trying\nsomething new. No one will.\n\nCorporations love to talk about risk management. The irony is that experimentation is the ultimate risk-management strategy because, when you experiment early, you can prevent the failure of something you will have spent billions\nof dollars on later. Netflix could have tested the waters with Qwikster. Instead, it\nwent full force on an idea that hadn’t been validated. The company was fortunate\nenough to be able to get immediate feedback and to change course, but that’s not\nalways the case for companies.\n\nSo many companies fail slowly. They release products and never measure\nwhether those products do anything. They just let them sit there, collecting dust\nin a sea of endless features, never knowing whether they are producing value.\nThis is the more dangerous and costly way to fail. Taking 10 years to fail, slowly\nburning through cash and never getting anywhere, is more problematic than\nallowing for smaller failures along the way.\n\nInstead, if you adopt a great product mindset and you give people the freedom to fail, what you’re doing is allowing them to fail quickly, quietly, and at a\nlower cost because they’re testing things early. That’s the type of failure you want\nto encourage. That’s the type of failure from which we can recover.\n\nIdeally, product managers should be risk mitigators who say, “Hey, I think\nthe most costly thing we can do is build this product without knowing it’s the\nright product to build.

We tested the feature with a small subset of users---\nenough to generate real data. At the end of the week, we found that we did not\nincrease sales at all. We pivoted and tried a different approach using emails to\ncommunicate with the fans. That increased sales by three times! I calculated out\nhow much fully executing on the original idea would have cost and compared it\nto the cost of the second idea. I went back to the CEO and explained, “We just\nsaved $250,000 and increased our sales three times by this other way of working.” He was ecstatic! We not only saved a ton of money, we hit our goals many\ntimes over.\n\nBy demonstrating, in small ways, the importance of this style of working, I\nwas able to gain the buy-in from my organization and get the safety I needed.

A CTO of a global financial services company once asked me for advice. As he moved up through the ranks in the\norganization, he realized that many of the issues it faced were a result of the way\nit was budgeting.\n\nHe explained it to me, “Every year, we go into a yearly planning cycle. The\nmanagement of the organization asks all the VPs what they plan to deliver. They\nhave the product managers write business cases, which they choose to fund.\nThose business cases are based off very little data, and they have some wild estimates on them. They turn all these business cases into a giant roadmap for the\nyear, give them out to each team, and fund the projects. At the end of the year, if\nthey do not deliver what’s on the roadmap, they do not get as much funding the\nnext year.”\n\n“Do you realize what that means, Melissa?” he asked me. “That means that,\nif a team finds a way to build a product cheaper---or finds that the product\nshouldn’t be built at all---they are building it anyway because they will be penalized if they don’t spend all their money.”\n\nThat. Is. Insane. Because these budgets are done on a yearly basis, it also\nreally kills the team’s ability to change course at all throughout the year. The\norganization is preventing itself from rapidly learning and iterating.\n\nIt’s far wiser to look at funding product development like a venture capitalist\n(VC). Startups must pitch investors on their vision and on the data they collect to\nprove that the vision will be viable and profitable in the market. They go to VCs\nand say, “This is where we are. These are our next goals. We need this much\nmoney to get to those goals.” The investment that VCs give the companies helps\nthem get to the next level, until they are profitable.

That if you did not judge people for\nsuccess by outcomes, you would never achieve those outcomes. I watched a few\ncompanies crumble under the weight of a bad strategic framework.\n\nBecoming a consultant taught me about the power of personalities in an\norganization. People will get in the way of a good product every time. Even if it is\nthe best idea for the company, if it doesn’t meet the personal agendas of senior\nstakeholders, it can be squashed.

And yet,\nbeing product-led is a winning strategy. If you look at some of the best companies out there today---Amazon, Netflix, and Google, for example---they are not\nreactively building whatever customer request comes their way. They are not following Agile processes blindly to build whatever features they can, as fast as they\ncan. Instead, they are developing products with the intent to deliver value to their\ncustomers.\n\nBeing agile, being customer-centric---these things are already baked into\ntheir culture. They understand that the fundamental criterion for building a\nproduct is that the product solves a problem for a user. They do not just build\nthings for the sake of checking boxes. They build things to further their business.\nTen years ago, when I started my journey in product management, I looked\naround and could barely find any peers. Now, smart and talented product managers abound, looking for the right organizations. They want to join product-led\norganizations, and they want to build kick-ass products that their customers love.\nIt is my hope that more organizations will escape the build trap, empower these\nproduct managers to thrive, and create products that we all enjoy.\n\nSo, if you want to determine whether yours is a product-led company---or\nhow far you might be from one---I leave you with these final six questions, which\nare the ones I ask whenever I am brought in to evaluate whether a company has\nescaped the build trap. They are also the questions that I suggest product managers ask during their interviews to see whether this will be the right environment\nin which for them to operate.\n\nHow do you stack up to being product-led?", "source_file": "Escaping_the_build_trap_-_Melissa_Perri.pdf", "extraction_method": "pdfminer", "ocr_used": false, "has_table": false, "l1_summary": "The truth is that most organizations out there are not product-led.

Well, our\nteam did. Right? That’s how it normally works.” This kind of response is a\nsign of a healthy product management organization, in which management sets the goals and the team is given room to figure out how to reach\nthem. The product manager should be leading the charge to discover user\nproblems and to solve them. This doesn’t mean that an important initiative\nor solution idea can’t come from management every once in a while, but\nthat should be the exception, not the rule.\n\nIt’s a huge red flag when a team not only can’t take ownership for what\nit is building, but can’t even tell me why it is building it.

Often, someone from marketing has promised a client that a particular feature is\nin the works and then the company feels committed to fully follow\nthrough with it. It doesn’t matter whether the client actually requested it or whether it achieves any of the organization’s desired goals.\n• Budgeting can’t budge. In some large organizations, in which the\nbudget is set at the beginning of the year, the team must spend all of\nit or else it will not receive an equally large budget the following year.\nThis concept is baffling, but it happens.\n\n• No pushback to management. Again, a lack of testing and questioning\npotential features signifies a lack of empowerment in a team. If a\nteam doesn’t feel like it is safe to say to management, “Hey, that\nthing we tested, well, it doesn’t work and we don’t think it’s worth\nthe money to build it,” the chances of a successful environment for\nproduct management is slim.\n\nWhen’s the last time you talked with your customers?\n\nWhat I dread hearing is, “Oh, well, management doesn’t really let us talk to\ncustomers. They’re worried about us annoying them too much.”\n\nWithout a healthy dialogue between a company and its customers,\nthere is no way to truly learn about what the customers want or need. An\norganization set up for success not only allows product managers to talk to\ncustomers, it encourages them to do so and recognizes this process as a\nhuge part of the job. In fact, your interviewee should be probing you for\nclues that you are comfortable talking to customers and that you aren’t\nplanning to spend all your time safely indoors writing user stories.\n\nWhat is your goal?\n\nThis is the first question I ask any product manager during an interview\nprocess.1 If the product manager cannot articulate a clear goal, it’s a sign of\npoor product management at the organizational level. If the product manager does have a goal but it is more output centric than outcome focused,\nthis also signifies an unhealthy product team. An output-centric team\nmeasures success in terms of meeting product shipment deadlines.

If the product manager does not understand the vision of the company, how are they supposed to figure out how\nto get there? Goals should be outcome oriented, actionable, and clearly\ncommunicated throughout the organization.\n\nWhat are you currently working on?\n\nA truly successful product manager talks more passionately about the problems the product development team is solving than the solutions they are\nshipping. This is one of the biggest signs of success, for me, and it goes\nhand-in-hand with the question of goals. When I ask product managers\nthis question, I want to hear about what big problems they are tackling for\nthe user and the business. Of course, they will talk about the solution, as\nwell, but more in the context of what it will do to help solve their problems.\nIf this mindset is encouraged throughout the organization, you can hear it\nechoed at all levels.\n\nWhat are your product managers like?\n\nAs product managers, we want to work in an organization where the role is\nrespected and well regarded. I’ve seen many organizations where the product management function was not well-respected. There were two causes:\nproduct managers were either seen as too strong, or they were seen as too\nweak.\n\nIn the first instance, product managers were seen as dictators who\nthrew out requirements to the team rather than involving them in their\ndecision-making process. The teams grew resentful and felt they were\ntreated as resources rather than as colleagues. A good product manager\nknows that getting buy-in from the whole team is crucial. The product\nmanager is not the only person who should be coming up with the ideas\nbut should instead be harnessing their team’s full capacity. A sign of a\nhealthy product team is hearing development and UX people say, “I love\nmy product manager. She has clear direction, communicates well, and\nhelps keep us stay focused on the goals and problems.”\n\nIn the second instance, product managers are seen as weak in the\norganization because they are beaten down by stakeholders2 and management.
