{"segment_id": "00003", "page_num": 3, "segment": "“Richard Rumelt really ‘gets it’! Too many strategy books delve into\nesoteric subjects and forget that a strategy is really about action.\nRumelt reinforces that a strategy is the set of actions an\norganization or team should implement and, just as important, the\nactions an organization should avoid as they drive forward in their\nmarket. As General George S. Patton is oft quoted, ‘A good plan\nviolently executed now is better than a perfect plan executed next\nweek.’ Good Strategy/Bad Strategy focuses the reader on developing a\nset of actions around identied trigger points and passionately\nimplementing those actions. The book contains many case examples\nthat illustrate Rumelt’s points. Richard Rumelt reinforces that a\nstrategy is not a goal or objective. It is the battle plan for action that\nis designed upon a unique set of attributes or conditions (kernels)\nthat set an organization apart from its competitors (leverages) and\nresults in exceptional and sustainable prots.”\n\n---Chuck Harrington, CEO of Parsons Corporation\n\n“This is the rst book on strategy I have read that I have found\ndicult to put down.

A small increase in the Fed’s\ninterest rate had triggered an increase in foreclosures. Lehman\nCEO Richard Fuld’s response, formalized in 2006, was a\n“strategy” of continuing to gain market share by growing faster\nthan the rest of the industry. In the language of Wall Street,\nLehman would do this by increasing its “risk appetite.” That is,\nit would take on the deals its competitors were rejecting.\nOperating with only 3 percent equity, and much of its debt\nsupplied on a very short-term basis, this policy should have\nbeen accompanied by clever ways of mitigating the increased\nrisk.

Die-hard fans of the original Macintosh were\noverjoyed, but the general business world was not expecting much.\n\nWithin a year, things changed radically at Apple. Although many\nobservers had expected Jobs to rev up the development of advanced\nproducts, or engineer a deal with Sun, he did neither. What he did\nwas both obvious and, at the same time, unexpected. He shrunk\nApple to a scale and scope suitable to the reality of its being a niche\nproducer in the highly competitive personal computer business. He\ncut Apple back to a core that could survive.\n\nSteve Jobs talked Microsoft into investing $150 million in Apple,\nexploiting Bill Gates’s concerns about what a failed Apple would\nmean to Microsoft’s struggle with the Department of Justice. Jobs\ncut all of the desktop models---there were fteen---back to one. He\ncut all portable and handheld models back to one laptop. He\ncompletely cut out all the printers and other peripherals.

A new Web store sold Apple’s\nproducts directly to consumers, cutting out distributors and dealers.\nWhat is remarkable about Jobs’s turnaround strategy for Apple is\nhow much it was “Business 101” and yet how much of it was\nunanticipated. Of course you have to cut back and simplify to your\ncore to climb out of a nancial nosedive. Of course he needed up-todate versions of Microsoft’s Oce software to work on Apple’s\ncomputers.

Even success, as at Tarawa,\nOkinawa or Hamburger Hill, can come at a terrible price.”2\n\nWhat these commentators did not predict was that General\nNorman Schwarzkopf, commander\nin chief of U.S. Central\nCommand, had a strategy for the ground war, a strategy he had\ndeveloped back in early October.\n\nThe original planhis sta, a direct attack into\nKuwait, was estimated to cost 2,000 dead and 8,000 wounded.\nSchwarzkopf rejected this approach in favor of a two-pronged plan.\nAir attacks would be used to reduce the Iraqi capabilities by 50\npercent. Then he planned a massive secret “left hook.” While the\nworld’s attention was focused on CNN’s 24/7 coverage of troops just\nsouth of Kuwait, the coalition would secretly shift a force of\n250,000 soldiers well west of Kuwait and then have them move\nnorth into positions in the empty desert of southern Iraq. When the\nground war began, this force would continue north and then turn\neast, completing the “left hook,” and slamming into the ank of the\nIraqi Republican Guard. Attacks aimed northward into Kuwait itself\nwere to be minor. The U.S. Marines ground forces were ordered to\nmove slowly northward into Kuwait, a ploy to entice the entrenched\nIraqis southward and out of their fortications, where they would\nbe hit from the side by part of the massive left hook. The sea-based\nmarines would not land, their oating presence being a diversion.\n\nSchwarzkopf’s combined-arms left-hook strategy was so successful\nthat the intense ground war lasted only one hundred hours. A\nmonth of air bombardment had conditioned Iraqi troops to disperse\nand hide their tanks and artillery, stay out of their vehicles, and\nkeep motors o. The swiftness and violence of the coalition ground\nassault, combining tanks, infantry, attack helicopters, and bombers,\nwas decisive. Republican Guard units fought bravely but were\nunable to maneuver or call in reserves fast enough to respond to the\nspeed and ferocity of the attack.

Or, if you\nwork in an enlightened company, you and your boss negotiate over\nyour goals. In either setting, it is natural to think of strategies as\nactions designed to accomplish specic goals. However, taking this\nway of thinking into a top-level position is a mistake.\n\nBeing a general manager, CEO, president, or other top-level leader\nmeans having more power and being less constrained. Eective\nsenior leaders don’t chase arbitrary goals. Rather, they decide which\ngeneral goals should be pursued. And they design the subgoals that\nvarious pieces of the organization work toward. Indeed, the cutting\nedge of any strategy is the set of strategic objectives (subgoals) it\nlays out. One of the challenges of being a leader is mastering this\nshift from having others dene your goals to being the architect of\nthe organization’s purposes and objectives.\n\nTo help clarify this distinction it is helpful to use the word “goal”\nto express overall values and desires and to use the word “objective”\nto denote specic operational targets. Thus, the United States may\nhave “goals” of freedom, justice, peace, security, and happiness. It is\nstrategy which transforms these vague overall goals into a coherent\nset of actionable objectives---defeat the Taliban and rebuild a\ndecaying infrastructure. A leader’s most important job is creating\nand constantly adjusting this strategic bridge between goals and\nobjectives.\n\nFor example, Chen Brothers was a rapidly growing regional\ndistributor of specialty foods.

Could its brand be stretched to other types of products and\neven other types of restaurants?\n\nAt Starbucks, one executive might diagnose this challenging\nsituation as “a problem in managing expectations.” Another might\ndiagnose it as “a search for new growth platforms.” A third might\ndiagnose it as “an eroding competitive advantage.” None of these\nviewpoints is, by itself, an action, but each suggests a range of\nthings that might be done and sets aside other classes of action as\nless relevant to the challenge. Importantly, none of these diagnoses\ncan be proven to be correct---each is a judgment about which issue is\npreeminent. Hence, diagnosis is a judgment about the meanings of\nfacts.\n\nThe challenge facing Starbucks was ill-structured. By that I mean\nthat no one could be sure how to dene the problem, there was no\nobvious list of good approaches or actions, and the connections\nbetween most actions and outcomes were unclear. Because the\nchallenge was ill-structured, a real-world strategy could not be\nlogically deduced from the observed facts. Rather, a diagnosis had\nto be an educated guess as to what was going on in the situation,\nespecially about what was critically important.\n\nThe diagnosis for the situation should replace the overwhelming\ncomplexity of reality with a simpler story, a story that calls\nattention to its crucial aspects. This simplied model of reality\nallows one to make sense of the situation and engage in further\nproblem solving.\n\nFurthermore, a good strategic diagnosis does more than explain a\nsituation---it also denes a domain of action. Whereas a social\nscientist seeks a diagnosis that best predicts outcomes, good strategy\ntends to be based on the diagnosis promising leverage over\noutcomes.

When faced with\na question or problem to which there is no obvious answer, it is\nhuman nature to welcome the rst seemingly reasonable answer\nthat pops into mind, as if it were a life preserver in a choppy sea.\nThe discipline of analysis is to not stop there, but to test that rst\ninsight against the evidence.

If a well was not pumped, others would empty the\nreservoir anyway. This created the forests of oil rigs and fantastic\nrates of development in early U.S. oil elds where overpumping was\nthe rule of the day.

Within\neighteen months, the price of oil had fallen from one dollar to 13\ncents per barrel, the eld’s pressure had collapsed, and water was\nseeping into the reservoir. Many members of the industry wanted\nsome way of stopping the “arms race,” but courts threw out plans to\ncontrol production as illegal price xing.

At that time, the dominant feeling in\nthe industry was that low-cost strategies would pull in lots of\nconsumers, but that the business traveler would remain relatively\ninsensitive to price.

The cable and\nsatellite companies are in much stronger positions, controlling key\ncomplementary assets. They probably should be licensing the\nsoftware rather than trying to build equipment.

What you get from a person is\nnot a conceptual framework or theory, but a viewpoint integrated\ninto a personality.

How much\nis too much? The combined plans in place for the Atlantic in 2001\namounted to 16,384 STM-1s. That would be enough capacity to\nallow thirty-ve million people, half in Europe and half in America,\nto broadcast continuous real-time video coverage of their lives to\none another, twenty-four hours a day seven days a week.\n\nCritically, as capacity surged on the transatlantic route, a\nsecondary market soon developed. Stuck with mountains of unused\ncapacity, the original customers, mostly national operators, tried to\nmake a little money by oering their unused capacity for resale or\non short-term leases. Fierce price competition quickly became the\nnorm. In late 1999, the price of an STM-1 collapsed from $6.5\nmillion to $2 million.
