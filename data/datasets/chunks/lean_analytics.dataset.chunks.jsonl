And we’ve broken the content into four big parts. • Part I focuses on an understanding of Lean Startup and basic analytics,\nand the data-informed mindset you’ll need to succeed. We review\na number of existing frameworks for building your startup and\nintroduce our own, analytics-focused one. This is your primer for the\nworld of Lean Analytics. At the end of this section, you’ll have a good\nunderstanding of fundamental analytics. • Part II shows you how to apply Lean Analytics to your startup. We look\nat six sample business models and the five stages that every startup goes\nthrough as it discovers the right product and the best target market. We\nalso talk about finding the One Metric That Matters to your business. When you’re done, you’ll know what business you’re in, what stage\nyou’re at, and what to work on. • Part III looks at what’s normal.

We’ve\nalso listed more than a dozen best-practice patterns you can apply right\naway. And we’ve broken the content into four big parts. • Part I focuses on an understanding of Lean Startup and basic analytics,\nand the data-informed mindset you’ll need to succeed. We review\na number of existing frameworks for building your startup and\nintroduce our own, analytics-focused one. This is your primer for the\nworld of Lean Analytics. At the end of this section, you’ll have a good\nunderstanding of fundamental analytics. • Part II shows you how to apply Lean Analytics to your startup. We look\nat six sample business models and the five stages that every startup goes\nthrough as it discovers the right product and the best target market. We\nalso talk about finding the One Metric That Matters to your business. When you’re done, you’ll know what business you’re in, what stage\nyou’re at, and what to work on. • Part III looks at what’s normal.

As a result, you hit the\nwall at a million miles an hour, lying to yourself the whole time. We’re not arguing against the importance of the reality distortion field---\nbut we do want to poke a few holes in it. Hopefully, as a result, you’ll see\nthe derailment in time to avoid it. We want you to rely less on your reality\ndistortion field, and rely more on Lean Analytics. Case st udy | Airbnb Photography---growth Within\n\ngrowth\n\nAirbnb is an incredible success story. In just a few years, the company\nhas become a powerhouse in the travel industry, providing travelers\nwith an alternative to hotels, and providing individuals who have\nrooms, apartments, or homes to rent with a new source of income. In 2012, travelers booked over 5 million nights with Airbnb’s service. But it started small, and its founders---adherents to the Lean Startup\nmindset---took a very methodical approach to their success. At SXSW 2012, Joe Zadeh, Product Lead at Airbnb, shared part of\nthe company’s amazing story. He focused on one aspect of its business:\nprofessional photography. It started with a hypothesis: “Hosts with professional photography will\nget more business. And hosts will sign up for professional photography\nas a service.” This is where the founders’ gut instincts came in: they had\na sense that professional photography would help their business.

Worse, you may be lying to yourself and fooling yourself into believing\nthat everything is OK. That’s no way to succeed. One other thing you’ll notice about metrics is that they often come in pairs. Conversion rate (the percentage of people who buy something) is tied to\ntime-to-purchase (how long it takes someone to buy something). Together,\nthey tell you a lot about your cash flow. Similarly, viral coefficient (the\nnumber of people a user successfully invites to your service) and viral cycle\ntime (how long it takes them to invite others) drive your adoption rate. As\nyou start to explore the numbers that underpin your business, you’ll notice\nthese pairs. Behind them lurks a fundamental metric like revenue, cash\nflow, or user adoption. If you want to choose the right metrics, you need to keep five things in\nmind:\n\nQualitative versus quantitative metrics\n\nQualitative metrics are unstructured, anecdotal, revealing, and hard\nto aggregate; quantitative metrics involve numbers and statistics, and\nprovide hard numbers but less insight. Vanity versus actionable metrics\n\nVanity metrics might make you feel good, but they don’t change how\nyou act. Actionable metrics change your behavior by helping you pick\na course of action. Exploratory versus reporting metrics\n\nExploratory metrics are speculative and try to find unknown insights\nto give you the upper hand, while reporting metrics keep you abreast of\nnormal, managerial, day-to-day operations. Leading versus lagging metrics\n\nLeading metrics give you a predictive understanding of the future; lagging metrics explain the past. Leading metrics are better because you\nstill have time to act on them---the horse hasn’t left the barn yet. Correlated versus causal metrics\n\nIf two metrics change together, they’re correlated, but if one metric\ncauses another metric to change, they’re causal. If you find a causal\nrelationship between something you want (like revenue) and something\nyou can control (like which ad you show), then you can change the\nfuture. 12\n\nPArt one: StoP LYIng to YoUrSeLF", "full_text": "Source: Lean_Analytics.pdf\n\nattached to a goal, in turn changing your behavior, you’re wasting your\ntime. Worse, you may be lying to yourself and fooling yourself into believing\nthat everything is OK. That’s no way to succeed. One other thing you’ll notice about metrics is that they often come in pairs. Conversion rate (the percentage of people who buy something) is tied to\ntime-to-purchase (how long it takes someone to buy something). Together,\nthey tell you a lot about your cash flow. Similarly, viral coefficient (the\nnumber of people a user successfully invites to your service) and viral cycle\ntime (how long it takes them to invite others) drive your adoption rate. As\nyou start to explore the numbers that underpin your business, you’ll notice\nthese pairs. Behind them lurks a fundamental metric like revenue, cash\nflow, or user adoption. If you want to choose the right metrics, you need to keep five things in\nmind:\n\nQualitative versus quantitative metrics\n\nQualitative metrics are unstructured, anecdotal, revealing, and hard\nto aggregate; quantitative metrics involve numbers and statistics, and\nprovide hard numbers but less insight. Vanity versus actionable metrics\n\nVanity metrics might make you feel good, but they don’t change how\nyou act. Actionable metrics change your behavior by helping you pick\na course of action. Exploratory versus reporting metrics\n\nExploratory metrics are speculative and try to find unknown insights\nto give you the upper hand, while reporting metrics keep you abreast of\nnormal, managerial, day-to-day operations. Leading versus lagging metrics\n\nLeading metrics give you a predictive understanding of the future; lagging metrics explain the past. Leading metrics are better because you\nstill have time to act on them---the horse hasn’t left the barn yet. Correlated versus causal metrics\n\nIf two metrics change together, they’re correlated, but if one metric\ncauses another metric to change, they’re causal.

And in October 2008, they\nlaunched Circle of Moms on Facebook. Initially, numbers dropped as a result of the new focus, but by 2009,\nthe team grew its community to 4.5 million users---and unlike the\nusers who’d been lost in the change, these were actively engaged. The\ncompany went through some ups and downs after that, as Facebook\nlimited applications’ abilities to spread virally.

Mike\ndiscovered an “unknown unknown” that led to a big, scary, gutsy bet\n(drop the generalized Circle of Friends to focus on a specific niche) that\nwas a gamble---but one that was based on data.

They pivoted. And in October 2008, they\nlaunched Circle of Moms on Facebook. Initially, numbers dropped as a result of the new focus, but by 2009,\nthe team grew its community to 4.5 million users---and unlike the\nusers who’d been lost in the change, these were actively engaged. The\ncompany went through some ups and downs after that, as Facebook\nlimited applications’ abilities to spread virally. Ultimately, the company\nmoved off Facebook, grew independently, and sold to Sugar Inc. in\nearly 2012. Summary\n\n• Circle of Friends was a social graph application in the right place at\n\nthe right time---with the wrong market. • By analyzing patterns of engagement and desirable behavior, then\nfinding out what those users had in common, the company found\nthe right market for its offering. • Once the company had found its target, it focused---all the way to\nchanging its name. Pivot hard or go home, and be prepared to burn\nsome bridges. Analytics Lessons Learned\n\nThe key to Mike’s success with Circle of Moms was his ability to dig\ninto the data and look for meaningful patterns and opportunities. Mike\ndiscovered an “unknown unknown” that led to a big, scary, gutsy bet\n(drop the generalized Circle of Friends to focus on a specific niche) that\nwas a gamble---but one that was based on data.

Not normalizing. Let’s say you’re making a list of popular wedding\ndestinations. You could count the number of people flying in for a\nwedding, but unless you consider the total number of air travellers\ncoming to that city as well, you’ll just get a list of cities with busy\nairports. 3.

They’re uneasy with their companies being optimized without\na soul, and see the need to look at the bigger picture of the market, the\nproblem they’re solving, and their fundamental business models. Ultimately, quantitative data is great for testing hypotheses, but it’s lousy\nfor generating new ones unless combined with human introspection. Pattern | How to think Like a Data Scientist\n\nMonica Rogati, a data scientist at LinkedIn, gave us the following 10\ncommon pitfalls that entrepreneurs should avoid as they dig into the\ndata their startups capture. 1. Assuming the data is clean. Cleaning the data you capture is often\nmost of the work, and the simple act of cleaning it up can often\nreveal important patterns. “Is an instrumentation bug causing\n30% of your numbers to be null?” asks Monica. “Do you really\nhave that many users in the 90210 zip code?” Check your data at\nthe door to be sure it’s valid and useful. 2. Not normalizing. Let’s say you’re making a list of popular wedding\ndestinations. You could count the number of people flying in for a\nwedding, but unless you consider the total number of air travellers\ncoming to that city as well, you’ll just get a list of cities with busy\nairports. 3. Excluding outliers. Those 21 people using your product more\nthan a thousand times a day are either your biggest fans, or bots\ncrawling your site for content. Whichever they are, ignoring them\nwould be a mistake. 4. Including outliers.", "tokens": 475, "metadata": {"source_file": "Lean_Analytics.pdf", "page_num": 65, "segment_id": "00065", "chapter_num": null, "chapter_title": null, "section_num": null, "section_title": null, "has_table": false}, "context": "Source: Lean_Analytics.pdf", "chunk_id": "00000067"}

It’s akin to Dave McClure’s retention phase. If your users aren’t\nsticky, churn will be high, and you won’t have engagement. Engagement is\none of the best predictors of success: Facebook’s early user counts weren’t\nhuge, but the company could get nearly all students in a university to use\nthe product, and to keep coming back, within a few months of launch. Facebook’s stickiness was off the charts. The fundamental KPI for stickiness is customer retention. Churn rates and\nusage frequency are other important metrics to track. Long-term stickiness\noften comes from the value users create for themselves as they use the\nservice. It’s hard for people to leave Gmail or Evernote, because, well, that’s\nwhere they store all their stuff. Similarly, if a player deletes his account\nfrom a massively multiplayer online game (MMO), he loses all his status\nand in-game items, which he’s worked hard to earn. Stickiness isn’t only about retention, it’s also about frequency, which is why\nyou also need to track metrics like time since last visit. If you have methods\nof driving return visits such as email notifications or updates, then email\nopen rates and click-through rates matter, too.

These clients are successful because they know they need\na large number of new customers at relatively low costs, and they\nconcentrate all of their marketing efforts around reliable, affordable\ncustomer acquisition. “It doesn’t matter whatsoever what mode a business is in. But it means\neverything for the CEO to know what mode he or she is in,” Kevin\nsays. “I see too many leaders trying to increase loyalty. If you’re in\nacquisition mode, you probably can’t---and shouldn’t try to---increase\nloyalty. The average customer only needs a couple of pairs of jeans a\nyear, for instance. You can’t force the customer to buy more! Knowing\nyour customer and mode is really important.”\n\nKevin says he frequently sees business leaders with seasonal e-commerce\nproperties trying to convince customers to buy gifts off-season. “It\ndoesn’t work,” he says. “They’re in acquisition mode.

You want high revenue per visitor, or high customer lifetime\nvalue (CLV), because that’s what’s really driving your business model. Keywords and Search terms\n\nMost people find products by searching for them, whether that’s in a web\nbrowser, on a search engine, or within a site. In each case, you want to\nknow which keywords drive traffic that turns into money. For paid search, you’re going to be bidding against others for popular\nkeywords in search engines like Google. Understanding which words\nare a comparatively good “value”---not too expensive, but still able to\ndrive a reasonable amount of traffic---is what search engine marketing\nprofessionals do for a living. For unpaid search, you’ll be more focused on good, compelling content\nthat improves your ranking with search engines, and on writing copy that\nincludes the desirable search terms your paying customers tend to use (so\nyou’ll be featured in search results because of your relevance).

Analytics Lessons Learned\n\nPage optimization is important. But be sure you’re optimizing the right\nmetric. You don’t just want a high conversion rate---though that’s\ngood. You want high revenue per visitor, or high customer lifetime\nvalue (CLV), because that’s what’s really driving your business model. Keywords and Search terms\n\nMost people find products by searching for them, whether that’s in a web\nbrowser, on a search engine, or within a site. In each case, you want to\nknow which keywords drive traffic that turns into money. For paid search, you’re going to be bidding against others for popular\nkeywords in search engines like Google. Understanding which words\nare a comparatively good “value”---not too expensive, but still able to\ndrive a reasonable amount of traffic---is what search engine marketing\nprofessionals do for a living. For unpaid search, you’ll be more focused on good, compelling content\nthat improves your ranking with search engines, and on writing copy that\nincludes the desirable search terms your paying customers tend to use (so\nyou’ll be featured in search results because of your relevance).

Describing a customer lifecycle in this way is a good method for\nunderstanding the key metrics that drive your business. This is where Lean\nStartup helps. You need to know which aspects of your business are too\nrisky and then work to improve the metric that represents that risk. Unfortunately, that’s not always possible. There’s no way to measure\nconversion rates if there are no users to convert. You can’t quantify virality\nif no paid customers are inviting new users. And you probably can’t measure\nstickiness for just a few people if the service requires a critical mass of users\nto be useful. This means you have to know where the risk is, but focus, in\nthe right order, on just enough optimization to get the business to a place\nwhere that risk can be quantified and understood. Let’s say that the company in our example is concerned about whether the\nproduct is good enough to make people use it consistently. This is usually\nthe right place to focus for SaaS companies, because they seldom get a\nsecond chance to make a first impression, and need users to keep coming\nback. In other words, they care about stickiness. The company will, of course, need some amount of conversion (and\ntherefore some amount of attention), but only enough to test stickiness. Those initial users could be acquired by word of mouth, or by direct selling,\nor by engaging with users on social networks. There’s probably no need for\na full-blown, automated marketing campaign at this stage.

Many of the vanity metrics\nwe’ve warned you about earlier are actually relevant to media sites, since\nthose sites make money from popularity. Ultimately, then, media sites care about:\n\nAudience and churn\n\nHow many people visit the site and how loyal they are. Ad inventory\n\nThe number of impressions that can be monetized. Ad rates\n\nSometimes measured in cost per engagement---essentially how much\na site can make from those impressions based on the content it covers\nand the people who visit. Click-through rates\n\nHow many of the impressions actually turn into money. Content/advertising balance\n\nThe balance of ad inventory rates and content that maximizes overall\nperformance. Audience and Churn\n\nThe most obvious metric for a media site is audience size. If we assume that\nan ad will get industry-standard click-through rates, then the more people\nwho visit your site, the more money you’ll make. Tracking the growth in audience size---usually measured as the number of\nunique visitors a month---is essential. But measuring unique visitors can\nlead us astray if we focus on it too much; as we’ve noted earlier, engagement\nis much more important than traffic, so knowing how many visitors you’re\nlosing, as well as adding, is critical.

This is\nan engagement funnel,* similar to the traditional conversion funnels of\nan e-commerce model---only instead of moving prospects toward buying,\nyou’re constantly trying to move your user population to higher and higher\nlevels of engagement, turning lurkers into voters, voters into commenters,\nand so on. * Altimeter group’s Charlene Li refers to this as an engagement pyramid. 125", "tokens": 294, "metadata": {"source_file": "Lean_Analytics.pdf", "page_num": 151, "segment_id": "00151", "chapter_num": "11", "chapter_title": "MoDeL FoUr: MeDIA SIte", "section_num": null, "section_title": null, "has_table": false}, "context": "Source: Lean_Analytics.pdf | Chapter 11: MoDeL FoUr: MeDIA SIte", "chunk_id": "00000165"}

Josh Breinlinger, a venture capitalist at Sigma West who previously ran\nmarketing at labor marketplace oDesk, breaks up the key marketplace\nmetrics into three categories: buyer activity, seller activity, and transactions. “I almost always recommend modeling the buyer side as your primary\nfocus, and then you model supply, more in the sense of total inventory,” he\nsays. “It’s easy to find people that want to make money; it’s much harder to\nfind people that want to spend money.”\n\nJosh cautions that just tracking buyer, seller, and inventory numbers isn’t\nenough: you have to be sure those numbers relate to the actual activity\nthat’s at the core of your business model. “If you wanted to juice those\nnumbers you could do so quite easily by tweaking algorithms, but you’re\nnot necessarily providing a better experience to users,” he says. “I believe\nthe better focus is on more explicit marketplace activity like bids, messages,\nlistings, or applications.”\n\nOnce you’ve got both sides of the market together, your attention (and\nanalytics) will shift to maximizing the proceeds from the market---the\nnumber of listings, the quality of buyers and sellers, the percentage of\nsearches for which you have at least one item in inventory, the marketplacespecific metrics Josh mentions, and ultimately, the sales volume and\nresulting revenue.", "tokens": 507, "metadata": {"source_file": "Lean_Analytics.pdf", "page_num": 169, "segment_id": "00169", "chapter_num": "11", "chapter_title": "MoDeL FoUr: MeDIA SIte", "section_num": null, "section_title": null, "has_table": false}, "context": "Source: Lean_Analytics.pdf | Chapter 11: MoDeL FoUr: MeDIA SIte", "chunk_id": "00000188"}

You can’t just start measuring everything at once. You have to measure\nyour assumptions in the right order. To do that, you need to know what\nstage you’re at. Our Lean Analytics stages suggest an order to the metrics you should focus\non. The stages won’t apply perfectly to everyone. We’ll probably get yelled\nat for being so prescriptive---in fact, we already have, as we’ve tested the\nmaterial for the book online and in events. That’s OK; we have thick skins. In a startup, your business model---and proof that your assumptions are\nreasonably accurate---is far more important than your business plan. Business plans are for bankers; business models are for founders. Deciding\nwhat business you’re in is usually quite easy. Deciding on the stage you’re\nat is complicated. This is where founders tend to lie to themselves. They\nbelieve they’re further along than they really are.

This requires enough discomfort with their situation that they actually do what you want---signing\nup, paying your price, etc. Enough people care\n\nSolving a problem for one person is called consulting. You need an\naddressable market. Marketers want audiences that are homogeneous\nwithin (that is, members of the segment have things in common to\nwhich you can appeal) and heterogeneous between (that is, you can\nsegment and target each market segment in a focused manner with a\ntailored message). They’re already trying to solve it\n\nIf the problem is real and known, people are dealing with it somehow. Maybe they’re doing something manually, because they don’t have a\nbetter way.

Let’s break down what that means:\n\nThe problem is painful enough\n\nPeople are full of inertia. You want them to act, and you want them to\ndo so in a way that helps your business. This requires enough discomfort with their situation that they actually do what you want---signing\nup, paying your price, etc. Enough people care\n\nSolving a problem for one person is called consulting. You need an\naddressable market. Marketers want audiences that are homogeneous\nwithin (that is, members of the segment have things in common to\nwhich you can appeal) and heterogeneous between (that is, you can\nsegment and target each market segment in a focused manner with a\ntailored message). They’re already trying to solve it\n\nIf the problem is real and known, people are dealing with it somehow. Maybe they’re doing something manually, because they don’t have a\nbetter way.

You not only want to hear what\npeople are saying, you also want to see how they’re saying it. People\nare generally much less distracted when meeting face-to-face, so\nyou’ll get a higher quality of response. • Pick a neutral location.

While you may adjust the script a bit\nover time, you’re not tweaking it constantly in order to “get the\nanswers you want” or rig anything in your favor. You have to stay\nhonest throughout the process. The script is probably the hardest thing to do well. Early on, you may\nnot even be sure what questions to ask.

Don’t dig too deeply, but make sure\nto ask her if there are other related problems that you didn’t touch\non. • Test the solution. Explore the subject’s worldview. Hand things\nover to the customer and listen. Go through each problem---in the\norder the subject ranked them---and ask the subject how she solves\nit today. There’s no more script. Just let the subject talk. This is\nthe point in the interview when you can really do a qualitative\nassessment of whether or not you’ve found problems worth solving.

Be careful. Most of the time, when people don’t have a problem, they’ll still\nagree with you. They don’t want to hurt your feelings. To be nice, they’ll\npretend they have the problem once you alert them to it. If you’re convinced\nthat people have the problem---and just need to be made aware of it---you\nneed to find ways to test that assumption. Some ways to get a more honest answer from people are:\n\n• Get them a prototype early on. • Use paper prototyping, or a really simple mockup in PowerPoint,\nKeynote, or Balsamiq, to watch how they interact with your idea\nwithout coaching. • See if they’ll pay immediately. • Watch them explain it to their friends and see if they understand how\n\nto spread the message. • Ask for referrals to others who might care.

The interviews typically lasted 10--15 minutes. “In my research, I found that there’s a good cross-section of people\non Mechanical Turk,” says Nick. “We found lots of highly educated,\ndiverse women that were very willing to speak with us about their\ndating experiences.”\n\n*\n\n http://customerdevlabs.com/2012/08/21/using-mturk-to-interview-100-customers-in-4-hours/\n\nCHAPter 15 : StAge one: eMPAtHY\n\n185", "tokens": 484, "metadata": {"source_file": "Lean_Analytics.pdf", "page_num": 211, "segment_id": "00211", "chapter_num": "11", "chapter_title": "MoDeL FoUr: MeDIA SIte", "section_num": null, "section_title": null, "has_table": false}, "context": "Source: Lean_Analytics.pdf | Chapter 11: MoDeL FoUr: MeDIA SIte", "chunk_id": "00000242"}

Developing a Product Plan\n\nThe product team is actively involved in defining the company’s annual\nstrategy. A big part of this is aligning the directions of the company\nand product. The product team focuses on answering the question\n“Why?” above everything else. “The articulation of why we’re doing\nsomething, and always questioning our focus, rallies everyone around\none compelling vision, company, and product, and creates a vital\nemotional connection with our customers,” Zach says. “Only once we\nunderstand ‘why’ can we really look at ‘what’ and ‘how’.”\n\nNow Rally is ready to dig into product. While this process may seem\nlike a lot, it’s very iterative and Lean. The company goes through a\nbuild→measure→learn cycle at several levels before getting to the point\nwhere it’s actually developing features. Deciding What to Build\n\nFeature development begins in earnest with deciding what to build and\nhow to build it. Rally has an open, but process-oriented, way of making\nfeature decisions.

Both the executive planning and the ORIDs feed into the next step of\nthe annual planning process: gathering 60 people from the company in\na highly-facilitated meeting to clearly articulate the vision for the year\nand align around how to accomplish it. Developing a Product Plan\n\nThe product team is actively involved in defining the company’s annual\nstrategy. A big part of this is aligning the directions of the company\nand product. The product team focuses on answering the question\n“Why?” above everything else. “The articulation of why we’re doing\nsomething, and always questioning our focus, rallies everyone around\none compelling vision, company, and product, and creates a vital\nemotional connection with our customers,” Zach says. “Only once we\nunderstand ‘why’ can we really look at ‘what’ and ‘how’.”\n\nNow Rally is ready to dig into product. While this process may seem\nlike a lot, it’s very iterative and Lean. The company goes through a\nbuild→measure→learn cycle at several levels before getting to the point\nwhere it’s actually developing features. Deciding What to Build\n\nFeature development begins in earnest with deciding what to build and\nhow to build it. Rally has an open, but process-oriented, way of making\nfeature decisions. Each quarter, employees submit short proposals for\nchanges to the company’s product direction. These proposals come\nfrom anyone in the organization, but are typically highly influenced by\ninteractions with customers.

Working out how long a customer takes to pay you\nback\n\nIf you’re relying on this revenue to grow, you’ll need some money. This is a\ngood time to fire up a spreadsheet and start playing with numbers: you now\nknow you need 5.7 months’ burn to keep the company running. EBItDA Breakeven\n\nEBITDA---earnings before income tax, depreciation, and amortization---\nis an accounting term that fell out of favor when the dot-com bubble burst. Many companies used this model because it let them ignore their large\ncapital investments and crushing debt. But in today’s startup world, where\nup-front capital expenses have been replaced by pay-as-you-go costs like\ncloud computing, EBITDA is an acceptable way to consider how well you’re\ndoing. Hibernation Breakeven\n\nA particularly conservative breakeven metric is hibernation. If you reduced\nthe company to its minimum---keeping the lights on, servicing existing\ncustomers, but doing little else---could you survive? This is often referred\nto as “ramen profitability.” There’s no new marketing spend. Your only\ngrowth would come from word of mouth or virality, and customers wouldn’t\nget new features.

Summary\n\n• WP Engine built a healthy WordPress hosting business, but losing\n\n24% of customers every year concerned its founders. • By asking around, the founder discovered that a 2% per month\n\nchurn rate was normal---even good---for that industry. • Knowing a good line in the sand allowed him to focus on other,\nmore important business objectives instead of trying to overoptimize churn. Analytics Lessons Learned\n\nIt’s easy to get stuck on one specific metric that looks bad and invest\nconsiderable time and money trying to improve it. Until you know\nwhere you stand against competitors and industry averages, you’re\nblind. Having benchmarks helps you decide whether to keep working\non a specific metric or move on to the next challenge.

Summary\n\n• WP Engine built a healthy WordPress hosting business, but losing\n\n24% of customers every year concerned its founders. • By asking around, the founder discovered that a 2% per month\n\nchurn rate was normal---even good---for that industry. • Knowing a good line in the sand allowed him to focus on other,\nmore important business objectives instead of trying to overoptimize churn. Analytics Lessons Learned\n\nIt’s easy to get stuck on one specific metric that looks bad and invest\nconsiderable time and money trying to improve it. Until you know\nwhere you stand against competitors and industry averages, you’re\nblind. Having benchmarks helps you decide whether to keep working\non a specific metric or move on to the next challenge.

For your whales to reach an\nARPPU of $20, some of them must be spending over $100. Is this possible? Your dolphins need to have a good reason to keep spending a little bit\nof money each month.

Part of this is simply getting the word out to new\nmarkets. “Most of the time, fan-made compilations and uploads to a\npersonal YouTube account go viral in the uploader’s specific market,”\nsays Carlos. “This has helped us expand our brand and audience to\nmarkets we never even thought of.”\n\nBut there’s another, more lucrative, reason for not having these videos\ntaken down. “Every time a fan ‘repurposes’ our content on his or\nher personal YouTube channel, we see it in our content management\nsystem, and we’re given a choice: either take it down, release our\nclaim, or reinstate our claim and monetize the uploaded content,” says\nPacheco. “In almost every case, we reinstate the content and monetize\nthese user-generated videos.”\n\nSince deciding to focus on YouTube, the channel has grown dramatically,\n“In the last year, on average, there are 100,000 user-generated Gags\nvideos that generate 40--50% of our total monthly views,” says Carlos. “I’ve seen two-hour mash-up videos of our content that have generated\nmillions of views, which is something we would never have thought of\ndoing.”\n\nAlthough fan-made videos bring in less revenue per engagement than\nGags’ original content, the sheer volume of views represents a significant\namount of total ad revenue. Carlos says, “I also pay attention to how\nfans are compiling these videos to see if we can learn from and mimic\ntheir success, since we often see UGC videos generate more views than\nours.”\n\nA Fundamentally new Opportunity\n\nCarlos points out that Gags’ growth on YouTube has happened\ncompletely independently from any marketing web support from the\nJust For Laughs festival or social media channels. Before February\n2012, Gags had no official Facebook page, Twitter account, or web\npresence. “Of course, a key success factor that helped Gags grow is the\nfact that it’s been on the air for over 10 years in over 100 countries. But until recently, our online presence was almost nonexistent,” says\nCarlos.", "tokens": 498, "metadata": {"source_file": "Lean_Analytics.pdf", "page_num": 355, "segment_id": "00355", "chapter_num": "11", "chapter_title": "MoDeL FoUr: MeDIA SIte", "section_num": null, "section_title": null, "has_table": false}, "context": "Source: Lean_Analytics.pdf | Chapter 11: MoDeL FoUr: MeDIA SIte", "chunk_id": "00000443"}

Armed with a decent caffeine\nallowance, you can talk to actual prospects fairly quickly. That said, there are plenty of important ways that enterprise sales are\ndifferent and more difficult than selling to a large, unwashed audience.

The math of choice modeling is complex. There are entire conferences\ndevoted to the subject, and it’s widely used in new product development for\neverything from laundry detergent to cars. But some of the methodologies\nare instructive. For example, you can get better answers by repeatedly\nasking your customers to compare two possible feature enhancements and\nchoosing the one they can do without, rather than by simply asking them\nto rate the possible features on a scale of 1 to 10. You’ll do even better if\nyou mix up several attributes in each comparison, regardless of whether a\nparticular combination of attributes makes sense. Imagine you’re trying to find a new diet food to introduce. You know the\nattributes that might affect buyers include taste, calories, gluten content,\nand sustainable ingredients. Simply asking prospects whether taste is more\nimportant to them than caloric content is informative. But asking them to\nmake a choice between two discrete offerings---even if those offerings are\ntheoretically impossible---is even better. Would you prefer:\n\n• A delicious, gluten-free, high-calorie candy made with artificial\n\ningredients;\n\n• Or a bland, high-gluten, low-calorie candy of organic origin? Asking customers to trade off variations of combinations, over and over,\ndramatically improves prediction accuracy. In fact, this is equivalent to\nthe multivariate testing we’ve discussed before, applied to surveys and\ninterviews.

The math of choice modeling is complex. There are entire conferences\ndevoted to the subject, and it’s widely used in new product development for\neverything from laundry detergent to cars. But some of the methodologies\nare instructive. For example, you can get better answers by repeatedly\nasking your customers to compare two possible feature enhancements and\nchoosing the one they can do without, rather than by simply asking them\nto rate the possible features on a scale of 1 to 10. You’ll do even better if\nyou mix up several attributes in each comparison, regardless of whether a\nparticular combination of attributes makes sense. Imagine you’re trying to find a new diet food to introduce. You know the\nattributes that might affect buyers include taste, calories, gluten content,\nand sustainable ingredients. Simply asking prospects whether taste is more\nimportant to them than caloric content is informative. But asking them to\nmake a choice between two discrete offerings---even if those offerings are\ntheoretically impossible---is even better. Would you prefer:\n\n• A delicious, gluten-free, high-calorie candy made with artificial\n\ningredients;\n\n• Or a bland, high-gluten, low-calorie candy of organic origin? Asking customers to trade off variations of combinations, over and over,\ndramatically improves prediction accuracy. In fact, this is equivalent to\nthe multivariate testing we’ve discussed before, applied to surveys and\ninterviews.

That’s what Bombardier\ndid when it expanded from snowmobiles to personal watercraft (despite an\ninitial, failed 1960s foray into the industry that was plagued by mechanical\nissues).†\n\nSkip the Business Case, Do the Analytics\n\nAt some point, when it comes time to go beyond interviewing people, you’ll\nneed to build a business case. Traditional product managers build profitand-loss analyses to try to justify their plans: they create a convincing\nbusiness case, and once someone believes it, they get funding to proceed. But a Lean mindset reverses this: you sell the business model---not the\nplan---without a lot of prediction, and then rely heavily on analytics to\ndecide whether to kill the product or double-down on it. This analyze-after rather than predict-before model is possible because\nmany of the costs of innovation can be pushed later in the product\ndevelopment cycle. Just-in-time manufacturing, on-demand printing,\nservices that replace upfront investment with pay-by-the-drink capacity,\nCAD/CAM design, and mercenary contractors all mean that you don’t\nhave to invest heavily up front (and therefore don’t have to argue a business\ncase at the outset). Rather, you can ask for a modest budget, build analytics\ninto the product, and launch sooner for less money. You can then use the\ndata and customer feedback you get, which is vanishingly cheap to collect\ngiven today’s technology, to plead your case based on actual evidence.
