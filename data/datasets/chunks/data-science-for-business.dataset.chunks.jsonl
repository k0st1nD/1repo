At the\nsame time, computers have become far more powerful, networking has become ubiquitous, and algorithms have been developed that can connect datasets to enable broader\nand deeper analyses than previously possible. The convergence of these phenomena has\ngiven rise to the increasingly widespread business application of data science principles\nand data-mining techniques. Probably the widest applications of data-mining techniques are in marketing for tasks\nsuch as targeted marketing, online advertising, and recommendations for cross-selling. 1", "tokens": 329, "metadata": {"source_file": "Data-Science-for-Business.pdf", "page_num": 25, "segment_id": "00025", "chapter_num": null, "chapter_title": null, "section_num": null, "section_title": null, "has_table": false}, "context": "Source: Data-Science-for-Business.pdf", "chunk_id": "00000024"}

{"type": "chunk", "text": "Fundamental concept: From a large mass of data, information technology can be used to\nfind informative descriptive attributes of entities of interest. In our churn example, a\ncustomer would be an entity of interest, and each customer might be described by a\nlarge number of attributes, such as usage, customer service history, and many other\nfactors. Which of these actually gives us information on the customer’s likelihood of\nleaving the company when her contract expires? How much information? Sometimes\nthis process is referred to roughly as finding variables that “correlate” with churn (we\nwill discuss this notion precisely). A business analyst may be able to hypothesize some\nand test them, and there are tools to help facilitate this experimentation (see “Other\nAnalytics Techniques and Technologies” on page 35). Alternatively, the analyst could\napply information technology to automatically discover informative attributes---essentially doing large-scale automated experimentation. Further, as we will see, this concept\ncan be applied recursively to build models to predict churn based on multiple attributes. Fundamental concept: If you look too hard at a set of data, you will find something---but\nit might not generalize beyond the data you’re looking at. This is referred to as overfitting a dataset. Data mining techniques can be very powerful, and the need to detect and\navoid overfitting is one of the most important concepts to grasp when applying data\nmining to real problems.

In our churn example, a\ncustomer would be an entity of interest, and each customer might be described by a\nlarge number of attributes, such as usage, customer service history, and many other\nfactors. Which of these actually gives us information on the customer’s likelihood of\nleaving the company when her contract expires? How much information? Sometimes\nthis process is referred to roughly as finding variables that “correlate” with churn (we\nwill discuss this notion precisely). A business analyst may be able to hypothesize some\nand test them, and there are tools to help facilitate this experimentation (see “Other\nAnalytics Techniques and Technologies” on page 35). Alternatively, the analyst could\napply information technology to automatically discover informative attributes---essentially doing large-scale automated experimentation. Further, as we will see, this concept\ncan be applied recursively to build models to predict churn based on multiple attributes. Fundamental concept: If you look too hard at a set of data, you will find something---but\nit might not generalize beyond the data you’re looking at. This is referred to as overfitting a dataset. Data mining techniques can be very powerful, and the need to detect and\navoid overfitting is one of the most important concepts to grasp when applying data\nmining to real problems.

Summary statistics should be chosen with close attention to the business problem to be\nsolved (one of the fundamental principles we will present later), and also with attention\nto the distribution of the data they are summarizing.

If we were to use that as a measure of the average income in order to make\npolicy decisions, we would be misleading ourselves. The distribution of incomes in the\nU.S. is highly skewed, with many people making relatively little and some people making\nfantastically much.

These\nquestions are all related but each is subtly different. It is important to understand these\ndifferences in order to understand what technologies one needs to employ and what\npeople may be necessary to consult. 1. Who are the most profitable customers? If “profitable” can be defined clearly based on existing data, this is a straightforward\ndatabase query. A standard query tool could be used to retrieve a set of customer\nrecords from a database. The results could be sorted by cumulative transaction\namount, or some other operational indicator of profitability. 2. Is there really a difference between the profitable customers and the average customer? This is a question about a conjecture or hypothesis (in this case, “There is a difference in value to the company between the profitable customers and the average\ncustomer”), and statistical hypothesis testing would be used to confirm or\ndisconfirm it.", "tokens": 496, "metadata": {"source_file": "Data-Science-for-Business.pdf", "page_num": 64, "segment_id": "00064", "chapter_num": null, "chapter_title": null, "section_num": null, "section_title": null, "has_table": false}, "context": "Source: Data-Science-for-Business.pdf", "chunk_id": "00000094"}

A data scientist would\nbecome familiar with the different alternatives for kernel functions (linear, polynomial,\nand others). Neural networks also implement complex nonlinear numeric functions, based on the\nfundamental concepts of this chapter. Neural networks offer an intriguing twist. One\ncan think of a neural network as a “stack” of models. On the bottom of the stack are the\noriginal features. From these features are learned a variety of relatively simple models. Let’s say these are logistic regressions. Then, each subsequent layer in the stack applies\na simple model (let’s say, another logistic regression) to the outputs of the next layer\ndown. So in a two-layer stack, we would learn a set of logistic regressions from the\noriginal features, and then learn a logistic regression using as features the outputs of the\nfirst set of logistic regressions. We could think of this very roughly as first creating a set\nof “experts” in different facets of the problem (the first-layer models), and then learning\nhow to weight the opinions of these different experts (the second-layer model).6\n\nThe idea of neural networks gets even more intriguing.

A data scientist would\nbecome familiar with the different alternatives for kernel functions (linear, polynomial,\nand others). Neural networks also implement complex nonlinear numeric functions, based on the\nfundamental concepts of this chapter. Neural networks offer an intriguing twist. One\ncan think of a neural network as a “stack” of models. On the bottom of the stack are the\noriginal features. From these features are learned a variety of relatively simple models. Let’s say these are logistic regressions. Then, each subsequent layer in the stack applies\na simple model (let’s say, another logistic regression) to the outputs of the next layer\ndown. So in a two-layer stack, we would learn a set of logistic regressions from the\noriginal features, and then learn a logistic regression using as features the outputs of the\nfirst set of logistic regressions. We could think of this very roughly as first creating a set\nof “experts” in different facets of the problem (the first-layer models), and then learning\nhow to weight the opinions of these different experts (the second-layer model).6\n\nThe idea of neural networks gets even more intriguing.

Holdout testing is similar to other sorts of evaluation in a “laboratory” setting. While a holdout set will indeed give us an estimate of generalization performance, it is\njust a single estimate. Should we have any confidence in a single estimate of model\naccuracy? It might have just been a single particularly lucky (or unlucky) choice of\ntraining and test data. We will not go into the details of computing confidence intervals\non such quantities, but it is important to discuss a general testing procedure that will\nend up helping in several ways. Cross-validation is a more sophisticated holdout training and testing procedure. We\nwould like not only a simple estimate of the generalization performance, but also some\nstatistics on the estimated performance, such as the mean and variance, so that we can\nunderstand how the performance is expected to vary across datasets.

Second, this phenomenon is not due to the training\ndata in Table 5-1 being atypical or biased. Every dataset is a finite sample of a larger\npopulation, and every sample will have variations even when there is no bias in the\nsampling. Finally, as we have said before, there is no general analytic way to determine\nin advance whether a model has overfit or not. In this example we defined what the\npopulation looked like so we could declare that a given model had overfit. In practice,\nyou will not have such knowledge and it will be necessary to use a holdout set to detect\noverfitting. From Holdout Evaluation to Cross-Validation\nLater we will present a general technique in broad use to try to avoid overfitting, which\napplies to attribute selection as well as tree complexity, and beyond.

Often, as\nwe see for the data in Figure 5-11, this leads logistic regression to perform better for\nsmaller datasets (not always, though). On the other hand, the figure also shows that the\nflexibility of tree induction can be an advantage with larger training sets: the tree can\nrepresent substantially nonlinear relationships between the features and the target. Whether the tree induction can actually capture those relationships needs to be evaluated empirically---using an analytical tool such as learning curves. 5. Perlich et al.

{"type": "chunk", "text": "This is a common approach. In modern environments with plentiful data and computational power, the data scientist routinely sets modeling parameters by experimenting\nusing some tactical, nested holdout testing (often nested cross-validation). The next section shows a different way that this method applies to controlling overfitting\nwhen learning numerical functions (as described in Chapter 4). We urge you to at least\nskim the following section because it introduces concepts and vocabulary in common\nuse by data scientists these days. * Avoiding Overfitting for Parameter Optimization\nAs just described, avoiding overfitting involves complexity control: finding the “right”\nbalance between the fit to the data and the complexity of the model. In trees we saw\nvarious ways for trying to keep the tree from getting too big (too complex) when fitting\nthe data. For equations, such as logistic regression, that unlike trees do not automatically\nselect what attributes to include, complexity can be controlled by choosing a “right” set\nof attributes. Chapter 4 introduced the popular family of methods that builds models by explicitly\noptimizing the fit to the data via a set of numerical parameters. We discussed various\nlinear members of this family, including linear discriminant learners, linear regression,\nand logistic regression. Many nonlinear models are fit to the data in exactly the same\nway. As might be expected given our discussion so far in this chapter and the figures in\n“Example: Overfitting Linear Functions” on page 119, these procedures also can overfit\nthe data. However, their explicit optimization framework provides an elegant, if technical, method for complexity control.

In modern environments with plentiful data and computational power, the data scientist routinely sets modeling parameters by experimenting\nusing some tactical, nested holdout testing (often nested cross-validation). The next section shows a different way that this method applies to controlling overfitting\nwhen learning numerical functions (as described in Chapter 4). We urge you to at least\nskim the following section because it introduces concepts and vocabulary in common\nuse by data scientists these days. * Avoiding Overfitting for Parameter Optimization\nAs just described, avoiding overfitting involves complexity control: finding the “right”\nbalance between the fit to the data and the complexity of the model. In trees we saw\nvarious ways for trying to keep the tree from getting too big (too complex) when fitting\nthe data. For equations, such as logistic regression, that unlike trees do not automatically\nselect what attributes to include, complexity can be controlled by choosing a “right” set\nof attributes. Chapter 4 introduced the popular family of methods that builds models by explicitly\noptimizing the fit to the data via a set of numerical parameters. We discussed various\nlinear members of this family, including linear discriminant learners, linear regression,\nand logistic regression. Many nonlinear models are fit to the data in exactly the same\nway. As might be expected given our discussion so far in this chapter and the figures in\n“Example: Overfitting Linear Functions” on page 119, these procedures also can overfit\nthe data. However, their explicit optimization framework provides an elegant, if technical, method for complexity control. The general strategy is that instead of just optimizing the fit to the data, we optimize some combination of fit and simplicity. Models\nwill be better if they fit the data better, but they also will be better if they are simpler.

Similarity underlies many data science methods and solutions to business problems. If\ntwo things (people, companies, products) are similar in some ways they often share\nother characteristics as well. Data mining procedures often are based on grouping things\nby similarity or searching for the “right” sort of similarity. We saw this implicitly in\nprevious chapters where modeling procedures create boundaries for grouping instances\ntogether that have similar values for their target variables. In this chapter we will look\nat similarity directly, and show how it applies to a variety of different tasks. We include\nsections with some technical details, in order that the more mathematical reader can\nunderstand similarity in more depth; these sections can be skipped. Different sorts of business tasks involve reasoning from similar examples:\n\n• We may want to retrieve similar things directly. For example, IBM wants to find\ncompanies that are similar to their best business customers, in order to have the\nsales staff look at them as prospects.

Exemplary techniques: Searching for similar entities; Nearest neighbor methods; Clustering methods; Distance metrics for calculating similarity. Similarity underlies many data science methods and solutions to business problems. If\ntwo things (people, companies, products) are similar in some ways they often share\nother characteristics as well. Data mining procedures often are based on grouping things\nby similarity or searching for the “right” sort of similarity. We saw this implicitly in\nprevious chapters where modeling procedures create boundaries for grouping instances\ntogether that have similar values for their target variables. In this chapter we will look\nat similarity directly, and show how it applies to a variety of different tasks. We include\nsections with some technical details, in order that the more mathematical reader can\nunderstand similarity in more depth; these sections can be skipped. Different sorts of business tasks involve reasoning from similar examples:\n\n• We may want to retrieve similar things directly. For example, IBM wants to find\ncompanies that are similar to their best business customers, in order to have the\nsales staff look at them as prospects.

For example, Netflix uses a form of nearest-neighbor classification\nfor their recommendations, and explains their movie recommendations with sentences\nlike:\n\n“The movie Billy Elliot was recommended based on your interest in Amadeus, The Constant Gardener and Little Miss Sunshine”\n\nAmazon presents recommendations with phrases like: “Customers with similar searches purchased...” and “Related to Items You’ve Viewed.”\n\nWhether such justifications are adequate depends on the application. An Amazon customer may be satisfied with such an explanation for why she got a recommendation. On the other hand, a mortgage applicant may not be satisfied with the explanation, “We\ndeclined your mortgage application because you remind us of the Smiths and the\nMitchells, who both defaulted.” Indeed, some legal regulations restrict the sorts of models that can be used for credit scoring to models for which very simple explanations can\nbe given based on specific, important variables. For example, with a linear model, one\nmay be able to say: “all else being equal, if your income had been $20,000 higher you\nwould have been granted this particular mortgage.”\n\nIt also is easy to explain how the entire nearest-neighbor model generally decides new\ncases. The idea of finding the most similar cases and looking at how they were classified,\nor what value they had, is intuitive to many. What is difficult is to explain more deeply what “knowledge” has been mined from the\ndata. If a stakeholder asks “What did your system learn from the data about my customers? On what basis does it make its decisions?” there may be no easy answer because\nthere is no explicit model. Strictly speaking, the nearest-neighbor “model” consists of\nthe entire case set (the database), the distance function, and the combining function.

For example, Netflix uses a form of nearest-neighbor classification\nfor their recommendations, and explains their movie recommendations with sentences\nlike:\n\n“The movie Billy Elliot was recommended based on your interest in Amadeus, The Constant Gardener and Little Miss Sunshine”\n\nAmazon presents recommendations with phrases like: “Customers with similar searches purchased...” and “Related to Items You’ve Viewed.”\n\nWhether such justifications are adequate depends on the application. An Amazon customer may be satisfied with such an explanation for why she got a recommendation. On the other hand, a mortgage applicant may not be satisfied with the explanation, “We\ndeclined your mortgage application because you remind us of the Smiths and the\nMitchells, who both defaulted.” Indeed, some legal regulations restrict the sorts of models that can be used for credit scoring to models for which very simple explanations can\nbe given based on specific, important variables. For example, with a linear model, one\nmay be able to say: “all else being equal, if your income had been $20,000 higher you\nwould have been granted this particular mortgage.”\n\nIt also is easy to explain how the entire nearest-neighbor model generally decides new\ncases. The idea of finding the most similar cases and looking at how they were classified,\nor what value they had, is intuitive to many. What is difficult is to explain more deeply what “knowledge” has been mined from the\ndata. If a stakeholder asks “What did your system learn from the data about my customers? On what basis does it make its decisions?” there may be no easy answer because\nthere is no explicit model.

As shown in Figure 6-11, the cluster centers typically shift;\nin the figure, we see that the new solid-lined stars are indeed closer to what intuitively\nseems to be the center of each cluster. And that’s pretty much it. The process simply\niterates: since the cluster centers have shifted, we need to recalculate which points belong\nto each cluster (as in Figure 6-10). Once these are reassigned, we might have to shift the\ncluster centers again. The k-means procedure keeps iterating until there is no change\nin the clusters (or possibly until some other stopping criterion is met).

You can decide which you prefer, but it’s important to point out they are different types\nof descriptions. Lapointe and Legendre’s is a characteristic description; it describes what\nis typical or characteristic of the cluster, ignoring whether other clusters might share\nsome of these characteristics. The onethe decision tree is a differential\ndescription; it describes only what differentiates this cluster from the others, ignoring\nthe characteristics that may be shared by whiskeys within it. To put it another way:\ncharacteristic descriptions concentrate on intergroup commonalities, whereas differential descriptions concentrate on intragroup differences.

{"type": "chunk", "text": "Problems with Unequal Costs and Benefits\nAnother problem with simple classification accuracy as a metric is that it makes no\ndistinction between false positive and false negative errors. By counting them together,\nit makes the tacit assumption that both errors are equally important. With real-world\ndomains this is rarely the case. These are typically very different kinds of errors with\nvery different costs because the classifications have consequences of differing severity. Consider a medical diagnosis domain where a patient is wrongly informed he has cancer\nwhen he does not. This is a false positive error. The result would likely be that the patient\nwould be given further tests or a biopsy, which would eventually disconfirm the initial\ndiagnosis of cancer. This mistake might be expensive, inconvenient, and stressful for\nthe patient, but it would not be life threatening. Compare this with the opposite error:\na patient who has cancer but she is wrongly told she does not. This is a false negative. This second type of error would mean a person with cancer would miss early detection,\nwhich could have far more serious consequences. These two errors are very different,\nshould be counted separately, and should have different costs. Returning to our cellular-churn example, consider the cost of giving a customer a retention incentive which still results in departure (a false positive error). Compare this\nwith the cost of losing a customer because no incentive was offered (a false negative). Whatever costs you might decide for each, it is unlikely they would be equal; and the\nerrors should be counted separately regardless. Indeed, it is hard to imagine any domain in which a decision maker can safely be indifferent to whether she makes a false positive or a false negative error. Ideally, we should\nestimate the cost or benefit of each decision a classifier can make. Once aggregated,\nthese will produce an expected profit (or expected benefit or expected cost) estimate for\nthe classifier. Generalizing Beyond Classification\nWe have been using classification modeling to illustrate many data science issues concretely. Most of these issues are applicable beyond classification. The general principle we’re developing here is that when we are applying data science\nto an actual application it is vital to return to the question: what is important in the\napplication?

By counting them together,\nit makes the tacit assumption that both errors are equally important. With real-world\ndomains this is rarely the case. These are typically very different kinds of errors with\nvery different costs because the classifications have consequences of differing severity. Consider a medical diagnosis domain where a patient is wrongly informed he has cancer\nwhen he does not. This is a false positive error. The result would likely be that the patient\nwould be given further tests or a biopsy, which would eventually disconfirm the initial\ndiagnosis of cancer. This mistake might be expensive, inconvenient, and stressful for\nthe patient, but it would not be life threatening. Compare this with the opposite error:\na patient who has cancer but she is wrongly told she does not. This is a false negative. This second type of error would mean a person with cancer would miss early detection,\nwhich could have far more serious consequences. These two errors are very different,\nshould be counted separately, and should have different costs. Returning to our cellular-churn example, consider the cost of giving a customer a retention incentive which still results in departure (a false positive error). Compare this\nwith the cost of losing a customer because no incentive was offered (a false negative). Whatever costs you might decide for each, it is unlikely they would be equal; and the\nerrors should be counted separately regardless. Indeed, it is hard to imagine any domain in which a decision maker can safely be indifferent to whether she makes a false positive or a false negative error. Ideally, we should\nestimate the cost or benefit of each decision a classifier can make. Once aggregated,\nthese will produce an expected profit (or expected benefit or expected cost) estimate for\nthe classifier.

Such comparisons help to justify the cost of each source by quantifying its value. If the contribution\nis negligible, the team may be able to reduce costs by eliminating it.

More specifically, with a ranking classifier, we can produce a list of instances and their\npredicted scores, ranked by decreasing score, and then measure the expected profit that\nwould result from choosing each successive cut-point in the list. Conceptually, this\namounts to ranking the list of instances by score from highest to lowest and sweeping\ndown through it, recording the expected profit after each instance. At each cut-point\nwe record the percentage of the list predicted as positive and the corresponding estimated profit. Graphing these values gives us a profit curve. Three profit curves are shown\nin Figure 8-2. This graph is based on a test set of 1,000 consumers---say, a small random population\nof people to whom you test-marketed earlier. (When interpreting results, we normally\nwill talk about percentages of consumers, so as to generalize to the population as a\nwhole.) For each curve, the consumers are ordered from highest to lowest probability\nof accepting an offer based on some model. For this example, let’s assume our profit\nmargin is small: each offer costs $5 to make and market, and each accepted offer earns\n$9, for a profit of $4. The cost matrix is thus:\n\np\n\n$4\n\nn\n\n-$5\n\nY\n\nN $0\n\n$0\n\nThe curves show that profit can go negative---not always, but sometimes they will, depending on the costs and the class ratio.", "tokens": 484, "metadata": {"source_file": "Data-Science-for-Business.pdf", "page_num": 236, "segment_id": "00236", "chapter_num": null, "chapter_title": null, "section_num": "0.99", "section_title": "- 0.43 × 0.39 + 0.57 × 0.79", "has_table": false}, "context": "Source: Data-Science-for-Business.pdf | Section 0.99: - 0.43 × 0.39 + 0.57 × 0.79", "chunk_id": "00000341"}

Many real-world domains are dominated by large numbers of negative instances (see\nthe discussion in “Sidebar: Bad Positives and Harmless Negatives” on page 188), so\nperformance in the far left-hand side of the ROC graph is often more interesting than\nelsewhere. If there are very many negative examples, even a moderate false alarm rate\ncan be unmanageable. A ranking model produces a set of points (a curve) in ROC space. As discussed previously, a ranking model can be used with a threshold to produce a\ndiscrete (binary) classifier: if the classifier output is above the threshold, the classifier\nproduces a Y, else an N. Each threshold value produces a different point in ROC space,\nas shown in Figure 8-4. Figure 8-4. Each different point in ROC space corresponds to a specific confusion matrix. Conceptually, we may imagine sorting the instances by score and varying a threshold\nfrom --∞ to +∞ while tracing a curve through ROC space, as shown in Figure 8-5.

The reason,\nin short, is that the two orderings are different and you can’t simply\npick-and-choose segments from each and expect the result to be optimal. The evaluation curves are only valid for each model individually, and all bets are off when you start mixing orderings from each.

Evidence in Action: Targeting Consumers with Ads\nIn spite of the math that appears in this chapter, the calculations are quite simple to\nimplement---so simple they can be implemented directly in a spreadsheet. So instead of\npresenting a static example here, we have prepared a spreadsheet with a simple numerical example illustrating Naive Bayes and evidence lift on a toy version of the online adtargeting example. You’ll see how straightforward it is to use these calculations, because\nthey just involve counting things, computing proportions, and multiplying and dividing. The spreadsheet can be downloaded here. The spreadsheet lays out all the “evidence” (website visits for multiple visitors) and\nshows the intermediate calculations and final probability of a ficticious advertising response. You can experiment with the technique by tweaking the numbers, adding or\ndeleting visitors, and seeing how the estimated probabilities of response and the evidence lifts adjust in response. Summary\nPrior chapters presented modeling techniques that basically asked the question: “What\nis the best way to distinguish (segment) target values?” Classification trees and linear\nequations both create models this way, trying to minimize loss or entropy, which are\nfunctions of discriminability. These are termed discriminative methods, in that they try\ndirectly to discriminate different targets. This chapter introduced a new family of methods that essentially turns the question\naround and asks: “How do different targets generate feature values?” They attempt to\nmodel how the data were generated. In the use phase, when faced with a new example\nto be classified, they apply Bayes’ Rule to their models to answer the question: “Which\nclass most likely generated this example?” Thus, in data science this approach to modeling is called generative, and it forms the basis for a large family of popular methods\n\nSummary\n\n|\n\n247", "full_text": "Source: Data-Science-for-Business.pdf | Section 0.99: - 0.43 × 0.39 + 0.57 × 0.79\n\nThis example also illustrates how it is important to think carefully about exactly what\nthe results mean in light of the data generating process.

Evidence in Action: Targeting Consumers with Ads\nIn spite of the math that appears in this chapter, the calculations are quite simple to\nimplement---so simple they can be implemented directly in a spreadsheet. So instead of\npresenting a static example here, we have prepared a spreadsheet with a simple numerical example illustrating Naive Bayes and evidence lift on a toy version of the online adtargeting example. You’ll see how straightforward it is to use these calculations, because\nthey just involve counting things, computing proportions, and multiplying and dividing. The spreadsheet can be downloaded here. The spreadsheet lays out all the “evidence” (website visits for multiple visitors) and\nshows the intermediate calculations and final probability of a ficticious advertising response. You can experiment with the technique by tweaking the numbers, adding or\ndeleting visitors, and seeing how the estimated probabilities of response and the evidence lifts adjust in response. Summary\nPrior chapters presented modeling techniques that basically asked the question: “What\nis the best way to distinguish (segment) target values?” Classification trees and linear\nequations both create models this way, trying to minimize loss or entropy, which are\nfunctions of discriminability. These are termed discriminative methods, in that they try\ndirectly to discriminate different targets. This chapter introduced a new family of methods that essentially turns the question\naround and asks: “How do different targets generate feature values?” They attempt to\nmodel how the data were generated. In the use phase, when faced with a new example\nto be classified, they apply Bayes’ Rule to their models to answer the question: “Which\nclass most likely generated this example?” Thus, in data science this approach to modeling is called generative, and it forms the basis for a large family of popular methods\n\nSummary\n\n|\n\n247", "tokens": 488, "metadata": {"source_file": "Data-Science-for-Business.pdf", "page_num": 271, "segment_id": "00271", "chapter_num": null, "chapter_title": null, "section_num": "0.99", "section_title": "- 0.43 × 0.39 + 0.57 × 0.79", "has_table": false}, "context": "Source: Data-Science-for-Business.pdf | Section 0.99: - 0.43 × 0.39 + 0.57 × 0.79", "chunk_id": "00000397"}

Consider the sample phrase “Famous jazz saxophonist born in Kansas who played bebop and latin.” We could imagine it being typed\nas a query to a search engine. How would it be represented? It is treated and processed\njust like a document, and goes through many of the same steps. First, basic stemming is applied. Stemming methods are not perfect, and can produce\nterms like kansa and famou from “Kansas” and “famous.” Stemming perfection usually\nisn’t important as long as it’s consistent among all the documents.

We mention a few articles here for anyone interested in pursuing\nthe topic. A survey by Mittermayer and Knolmayer (2006) is a good place to start, though it is a\nbit dated by now. It provides a good overview of approaches up to that point. Most researchers view the problem as predicting the stock market from news. In this\nchapter, we’ve taken an inverse view as that of recommending news stories based on\ntheir future effects. This task was termed information triage by Macskassy et al. (2001). Early work looked at the effect of financial news in the mainstream media. Later work\ntakes into account opinions and sentiment from other sources on the Internet, such as\nTwitter updates, blog postings, and search engine trends. A paper by Mao et al.

The point is that the\nexpected value framework provides a helpful decomposition of possibly complicated\nbusiness problems into subproblems that we understand better how to solve. The\nframework also shows exactly how to put the pieces together. For our example problem\n(chosen for its straightforward derivation), the answer works out to the intuitively satisfying result: mail to those people whose estimated expected donation is greater than\nthe cost associated with mailing! Mathematically, we simply look for those whose expected benefit of targeting is greater than zero, and simplify the inequality algebraically. Let dR(x) be the estimated donation if consumer x were to respond, and let c be the\nmailing cost. Then:\n\nExpected benefit of targeting = p(R | ) · vR() + 1 - p(R | ) · vNR()\n\nWe always want this benefit to be greater than zero, so:\n\np(R | ) · (dR() - c) + 1 - p(R | ) · ( - c) >\np(R | ) · dR() - p(R | ) · c - c + p(R | ) · c >\np(R | ) · dR() >\n\n0\n\n0\n\nc\n\nThat is, the expected donation (lefthand side) should be greater than the solicitation\ncost (righthand side).

Specifically, we need to consider\nwhat would happen if we did not target (looking at both EBT and EBnotT), as well as what\nis the actual influence of the incentive (taking the difference of EBT and EBnotT).1\n\nLet’s take another brief mathematical digression to illustrate. Consider the conditions\nunder which this “value of targeting,” VT = EBT(x) - EBnotT(x), would be the largest. Let’s\nexpand the equation for VT, but at the same time simplify by assuming that we get no\nvalue from a customer if she does not stay. Equation 11-1. VT decomposition\n\nVT =\n\n=\n\n=\n\np(S | , T ) · uS() - p(S | , notT ) · uS() - c\np(S | , T ) - p(S | , notT ) · uS() - c\nΔ(p) · uS() - c\n\nwhere Δ(p) is the difference in the predicted probabilities of staying, depending on\nwhether the customer is targeted or not. Again we see an intuitive result: we want to\ntarget those customers with the greatest change in their probability of staying, moderated by their value if they were to stay! In other words, target those with the greatest\nchange in their expected value as a result of targeting. (The -c is the same for everyone\nin our scenario, and including it here simply assures that the VT is not expected to be\na monetary loss.)\n\nIt’s important not to lose track: this was all work in our Business Understanding phase. Let’s turn to the implications for the rest of the data mining process.

Associations Among Facebook Likes\nAlthough finding associations is often used with market basket data---and sometimes\nis even called market-basket analysis---the technique is much more general. We can use\nour example from Chapter 9 of “Likes” on Facebook to illustrate. Recall that we have\ndata on the things that were “Liked” by a large collection of users of Facebook (Kosinski,\nStillwell, & Graepel, 2013). By analogy to market basket data, we can consider each of\nthese users to have a “basket” of Likes, by aggregating all the Likes of each user. Now we\ncan ask, do certain Likes tend to co-occur more frequently than we would expect by\nchance? We will use this simply as an interesting example to illustrate association finding, but the process could actually have an important business application. If you are a\nmarketer looking to understand the consumers in a particular market, you might be\ninterested in finding patterns of things people Like.

Before we get to the mining of the data, let’s introduce one more useful idea for association finding. Since we’re using the market basket as an analogy at this point, we should\nconsider broadening our thinking of what might be an item.

There are two other significant statistics we should calculate too: the support and the\nstrength. The support of the association is just the prevalence in the data of buying the\ntwo items together, p(lottery tickets, beer), which is 20%. The strength is the conditional\nprobability, p(lottery tickets|beer), which is 67%. Associations Among Facebook Likes\nAlthough finding associations is often used with market basket data---and sometimes\nis even called market-basket analysis---the technique is much more general. We can use\nour example from Chapter 9 of “Likes” on Facebook to illustrate. Recall that we have\ndata on the things that were “Liked” by a large collection of users of Facebook (Kosinski,\nStillwell, & Graepel, 2013). By analogy to market basket data, we can consider each of\nthese users to have a “basket” of Likes, by aggregating all the Likes of each user. Now we\ncan ask, do certain Likes tend to co-occur more frequently than we would expect by\nchance? We will use this simply as an interesting example to illustrate association finding, but the process could actually have an important business application. If you are a\nmarketer looking to understand the consumers in a particular market, you might be\ninterested in finding patterns of things people Like.

Once we have defined an instance to be a pair of people, we can proceed smoothly. Next,\nwhat would be the target variable? Whether the relationship exists, or would be formed\nif recommended. Would this be a supervised task? Yes, we can get training data where\nlinks already do or do not exist, or if we wanted to be more careful we could invest in\nacquiring labels specifically for the recommendation task (we would need to spend a\nbit more time than we have here on defining the exact semantics of the link). What\nwould be the features? These would be features of the pair of people, such as how many\ncommon friends the two individuals have, what is the similarity in their interests, and\nso on. Now that we have cast the problem in the form of a predictive modeling task, we\ncan start to ask what sorts of models we would apply and how we would evaluate them.

This means that social network neighbors are likely to have similar product preferences,\nand we would expect the neighbors of people who choose or like a product also to choose\nor like the product, even in the absence of any causal influence among the consumers! Indeed, based on the careful application of causal analysis, it was shown in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (Aral, Muchnik, & Sundararajan, 2009)\nthat traditional methods for estimating the influence in viral marketing analysis overestimated the influence by at least 700%! There are various methods for careful causal explanation from data, and they can all be\nunderstood within a common data science framework. The point of discussing this here\ntoward the end of the book is that understanding these sophisticated techniques requires\na grasp of the fundamental principles presented so far. Careful causal data analysis requires the understanding of investments in acquiring data, of similarity measurements,\nof expected value calculations, of correlation and finding informative variables, of fitting\nequations to data, and more. Chapter 11 gave a taste of this more sophisticated causal analysis when we returned to\nthe telecommunications churn problem and asked: shouldn’t we be targeting those customers whom the special offer is most likely to influence? This illustrated the key role\nthe expected value framework played, along with several other concepts. There are other\ntechniques for causal understanding that use similarity matching (Chapter 6) to simulate the “counterfactual” that someone might both receive a “treatment” (e.g., an incentive to stay) and not receive the treatment. Still other causal analysis methods fit numeric\nfunctions to data and interpret the coefficients of the functions.10\n\nThe point is that we cannot understand causal data science without first understanding\nthe fundamental principles. Causal data analysis is just one such example; the same\napplies to other more sophisticated methods you may encounter. Summary\nThere are very many specific techniques used in data science.

Indeed, based on the careful application of causal analysis, it was shown in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (Aral, Muchnik, & Sundararajan, 2009)\nthat traditional methods for estimating the influence in viral marketing analysis overestimated the influence by at least 700%! There are various methods for careful causal explanation from data, and they can all be\nunderstood within a common data science framework. The point of discussing this here\ntoward the end of the book is that understanding these sophisticated techniques requires\na grasp of the fundamental principles presented so far. Careful causal data analysis requires the understanding of investments in acquiring data, of similarity measurements,\nof expected value calculations, of correlation and finding informative variables, of fitting\nequations to data, and more. Chapter 11 gave a taste of this more sophisticated causal analysis when we returned to\nthe telecommunications churn problem and asked: shouldn’t we be targeting those customers whom the special offer is most likely to influence? This illustrated the key role\nthe expected value framework played, along with several other concepts. There are other\ntechniques for causal understanding that use similarity matching (Chapter 6) to simulate the “counterfactual” that someone might both receive a “treatment” (e.g., an incentive to stay) and not receive the treatment. Still other causal analysis methods fit numeric\nfunctions to data and interpret the coefficients of the functions.10\n\nThe point is that we cannot understand causal data science without first understanding\nthe fundamental principles. Causal data analysis is just one such example; the same\napplies to other more sophisticated methods you may encounter. Summary\nThere are very many specific techniques used in data science. To achieve a solid understanding of the field, it is important to step back from the specifics and think about\nthe sorts of tasks to which the techniques are applied.

Sustaining Competitive Advantage with Data Science\nThe next question is: even if we can achieve competitive advantage, can we sustain it? If our competitors can easily duplicate our assets and capabilities, our advantage may\nbe short-lived. This is an especially critical question if our competitors have greater\nresources than we do: by adopting our strategy, they may surpass us if they have greater\nresources.

This can\nidentify both possible opportunities and possible threats. A direct data science analogy\nof the Dell-Compaq example is Amazon versus Borders. Even very early, Amazon’s data\non customers’ book purchases allowed personalized recommendations to be delivered\nto customers while they were shopping online.

Read case studies that actually walk through the data\nmining process. Formulate your own case studies. Actually mining data is helpful, but\neven more important is working through the connection between the business problem\nand the possible data science solutions. The more, different problems you work through,\nthe better you will be at naturally seeing and capitalizing on opportunities for bringing\nto bear the information and knowledge “stored” in the data---often the same problem\nformulation from one problem can be applied by analogy to another, with only minor\nchanges. It is important to keep in mind that the examples we have presented in this book were\nchosen or designed for illustration. In reality, the business and data science team should\nbe prepared for all manner of mess and contraints, and must be flexible in dealing with\nthem.

Appendix A provides a starting guide\nfor reviewing such proposals, with some of the main questions to ask. However, this\nbook as a whole really can be seen as a proposal review guide.

For example, over what time period must\n\nthe migration occur? (Chapter 3)\n\n• The formulation of the data mining problem could be better-aligned with the business problem. For example, what if certain customers (or everyone) were likely to\nmigrate anyway (without the incentive)? Then we would be wasting the cost of the\nincentive in targeting them. (Chapter 2, Chapter 11)\n\nData Understanding/Data Preparation\n\n• There aren’t any labeled training data! This is a brand-new incentive. We should\ninvest some of our budget in obtaining labels for some examples. This can be done\nby targeting a (randomly) selected subset of customers with the incentive. One also\nmight propose a more sophisticated approach (Chapter 2, Chapter 3, Chapter 11). • If we are worried about wasting the incentive on customers who are likely to migrate\nwithout it, we also should observe a “control group” over the period where we are\nobtaining training data. This should be easy, since everyone we don’t target to gather\nlabels would be a “control” subject. We can build a separate model for migrate or\nnot given no incentive, and combine the models in an expected value framework. (Chapter 11)\n\nModeling\n\n• Linear regression is not a good choice for modeling a categorical target variable. Rather one should use a classification method, such as tree induction, logistic regression, k-NN, and so on. Even better, why not try a bunch of methods and evaluate\nthem experimentally to see which performs best?

One dimension that is very important for strategic planning is the firm’s “maturity,” specifically,\nhow systematic and well founded are the processes used to guide the firm’s data science\nprojects.3\n\nAt one end of the maturity spectrum, a firm’s data science processes are completely ad\nhoc. In many firms, the employees engaged in data science and business analytics endeavors have no formal training in these areas, and the managers involved have little\nunderstanding of the fundamental principles of data science and data analytic thinking. 3. The reader interested in this notion of the maturity of a firm’s capabilities is encouraged to read about the\n\nCapability Maturity Model for software engineering, which is the inspiration for this discussion.

The structure imposed by the process emphasizes the interaction of humans early, to ensure that the\napplication of data science methods are focused on the right tasks. Examining the data\nmining process also reveals that task selection and specification is not the only place\nwhere human interaction is critical. As discussed in Chapter 2, one of the places where\nhuman creativity, knowledge, and common sense adds value is in selecting the right\ndata to mine---which is far too often overlooked in discussions of data mining, especially\nconsidering its importance. 3.

The type ordinal\ndenotes that there is an ordering, such\nas in an attribute taking on the values\nlow, medium, or high. • Continuous (quantitative): Commonly, subset of real numbers, where\nthere is a measurable difference between the possible values. Integers are\nusually treated as continuous in practical problems.
