In continuous delivery, we invest in building a culture\n\nsupported by tools and people where we can detect any issues\n\nquickly, so that they can be xed straight away when they are cheap\n\nto detect and resolve. Work in small batches. Organizations tend to plan work in big\n\nchunks--whether building new products or services or investing in\n\norganizational change. By splitting work up into much smaller\n\nchunks that deliver measurable business outcomes quickly for a\n\nsmall part of our target market, we get essential feedback on the\n\nwork we are doing so that we can course correct. Even though\n\nworking in small chunks adds some overhead, it reaps enormous\n\nrewards by allowing us to avoid work that delivers zero or negative\n\nvalue for our organizations. A key goal of continuous delivery is changing the economics of\n\nthe software delivery process so the cost of pushing out individual\n\nchanges is very low. Computers perform repetitive tasks; people solve problems. One important strategy to reduce the cost of pushing out changes\n\nis to take repetitive work that takes a long time, such as regression\n\ntesting and software deployments, and invest in simplifying and", "tokens": 357, "metadata": {"source_file": "Forsgren N., Humble J., Kim G.- Accelerate.

In order to reduce deployment pain, we should:\n\nBuild systems that are designed to be deployed easily into multiple\n\nenvironments, can detect and\n\ntolerate\n\nfailures\n\nin\n\ntheir\n\nenvironments, and can have various components of the system\n\nupdated independently\n\nEnsure that the state of production systems can be reproduced\n\n(with the exception of production data) in an automated fashion\n\nfrom information in version control\n\nBuild intelligence into the application and the platform so that the\n\ndeployment process can be as simple as possible\n\nApplications designed for a platform-as-a-service, such as Heroku,\n\nPivotal Cloud Foundry, Red Hat OpenShift, Google Cloud Platform,\n\nAmazon Web Services, or Microsoft Azure, can typically be deployed using\na single command.2\n\nNow that we've discussed deployment pain and covered some\n\nstrategies to counteract it, let's move on to burnout.

It doesn't matter what they call it at\n\ntheir organization--it matters what they have been asked in the survey. It\n\ndoes matter what they are asked, and so the quality and clarity of the\n\nsurvey items become that much more important. But once the work of\n\nsurvey writing is done, the work of cleaning and preparing the data for\n\nanalysis is faster and more straightforward. In rigorous research, additional analyses (e.g., common method\n\nvariance checks) are run to ensure that the survey itself hasn't introduced\n\nbias into the results, and responses are checked for bias between early and\n\nlate responders (see Appendix C).", "tokens": 375, "metadata": {"source_file": "Forsgren N., Humble J., Kim G.- Accelerate.

If an employee's spouse or partner receives a job offer that requires\n\nrelocation and your employee decides to follow them, their\n\nturnover probably has nothing to do with culture. If an employee decides to pursue a different career or return to\n\nschool, this may have nothing to do with the culture and more to\n\ndo with their personal journey. In fact, one of the authors knows\n\nof a case where an employee worked at a very supportive,\n\nencouraging company and on a great team. It was that great team\n\nenvironment that encouraged him to follow his dreams and pursue\n\na change in career so he could continue being challenged. In this\n\ncase, the strong culture resulted in turnover, not the opposite. ese measures can be gamed. If an employee's manager nds out\n\nthey are actively looking for a job, the manager may lay the person\n\noff to make sure the employee is not counted in any turnover\n\nnumbers.

If the experiment is a success, they make it part of the\n\nstandard work, share the learning, and continue to monitor to ensure the\n\nimprovement is sustained. ey apply this problem-solving approach at all\n\nlevels of the organization.

We run into Danny Wijnand, a\n\nchief design engineer who worked under Jannes until he was promoted last\n\nyear to lead his own tribe.

Storytelling is\n\nimportant, but they have to have their own learning.\"\n\nBack again on the tribe oor, we visit with Jan Rijkhoff, a chapter lead. We wanted to learn about his chapter's current approach to problem\n\nsolving. Over the years, they have experimented with different problemsolving methods, including A3, Kata, Lean startup, and others, and nally\n\nsettled on a blend of elements that they found helpful, creating their own\n\napproach. In our walk today, we have seen evidence of multiple problemsolving initiatives in ight and visualized on the walls. eir approach is to gather the right people who have experience and\n\ninsights into the problem to rigorously examine the current condition. is\n\nrigor pays off, as the team gains insights that increase the probability of\n\nidentifying the root cause rather than just the symptoms. With this\n\nlearning, they form a hypothesis about an approach to improvement,\n\nincluding how and what to measure to learn if the experiment produces the\n\ndesired outcomes. If the experiment is a success, they make it part of the\n\nstandard work, share the learning, and continue to monitor to ensure the\n\nimprovement is sustained. ey apply this problem-solving approach at all\n\nlevels of the organization.

When used\n\neffectively, this drives process improvement, increases throughput,\n\nand makes constraints visible in the system. See Chapter 7. 19. Visualize work to monitor quality and communicate\n\nthroughout the team. Visual displays, such as dashboards or\n\ninternal websites, used to monitor quality and work in process have\n\nbeen shown to contribute to software delivery performance. See\n\nChapter 7.

Our industry has always struggled with\n\napplying science to the development and operation of software products\n\nand services. e social systems that support software delivery are too\n\nirreducibly complex to make randomized, controlled experiments\n\npractical. In retrospect, the solution was clear: use behavioral science to\n\nstudy these systems. Nicole's careful, thorough pioneering of this\n\napproach has produced incredible results, and it's hard to overstate the\n\nimpact of her work. It's been an honor to be her partner in this research,\n\nand I've learned an enormous amount. ank you. e reason I'm involved with this project at all is Gene, who invited me\n\nto be part of the State of DevOps team back in 2012. Gene, your passion\n\nfor this project--and, on a personal level, for challenging my hypotheses\n\nand analysis (yes, I'm talking about trunk-based development)--has made\n\nthis both substantially more rigorous and highly rewarding. I also want to thank the Puppet team who've contributed so much to\n\nthis work and without whom it wouldn't exist, particularly Alanna Brown,\n\nNigel Kersten, and Aliza Earnshaw. ank you.
