How is Blaze going to feel about this? Nell: That makes sense. Seems unfair to the\nvendor, though. Ian: Maybe, but the reps do have the chance\nto wow us during the visit and turn us around. I’ll be surprised if they do, though. Boy, do I feel better having clarified Ian’s\nthinking. He wasn’t overruling me after all! Nell: Me too! Wow, that shifted my thinking completely. I only got a short distance up the\nLadder of Inference, to the Meanings rung, before the realization hit me. Now,\ninstead of the story I started with---“Ian doesn’t listen and just does what he\nwants”---I am starting to believe that “Ian listens to my opinions and wants my\nteam to learn to select vendors well.”\n\nIf we keep confirming this shared story, it will become much easier for me\nto trust him in the future and for us both to jointly design solutions to our\npartner-management problems. Example Trust Conversations\n\nNow let's dig a little deeper and look at some more examples of the Trust\nConversation in action.

{"type": "chunk", "text": "Trust Breaks Down the Wall\n\nIt’s not an understatement to say that the Trust Conversation between Leo\nand Paul was the turning point in improving relationships and performance\nacross the whole organization. With Leo’s support, Paul was able to engage\nmuch more closely with the developers, and then to bring others from the\n“nontech” room into demos and design sessions for successful interactions. And engineers, singly and in groups, were able to question Paul about\nprevious decisions, building faith that he and others in the rest of the\nbusiness were not acting capriciously. Over time, the greater cooperation\nbetween the two “sides” led to better product decisions and improved\ncustomer satisfaction. Today, four years later, Leo is now the VP of Engineering and works\nclosely with Paul in a mutually trusting relationship.

With Leo’s support, Paul was able to engage\nmuch more closely with the developers, and then to bring others from the\n“nontech” room into demos and design sessions for successful interactions. And engineers, singly and in groups, were able to question Paul about\nprevious decisions, building faith that he and others in the rest of the\nbusiness were not acting capriciously. Over time, the greater cooperation\nbetween the two “sides” led to better product decisions and improved\ncustomer satisfaction.

After\na few minutes, smoke began to ow into the room from a wall vent. Everyone kept writing; none of the students said a word. More smoke\nbillowed in, and it became hard to see. Nothing happened. No one made a\nmove to get help or even asked what was going on.

An executive who imposes a Why from\nabove---or worse, with only a sham consultation---does more harm than\ngood.

Notice that we didn’t say that in Jeffrey’s case the team should agree on a\nsingle, public denition of done (DoD), an Agile practice particularly used by\nScrum teams. We certainly think that a denition of done can be very helpful,\nand it might have indeed assisted Jeffrey and his team, but it doesn’t give a\nguarantee against commitment miscommunication. For instance, the team\nmight have dened “done” as “passes all unit tests, product manager veries\nfunctionality, code in production,” and by this denition the login screen was\ndone. e problem was, as always, an interpersonal one; Jeffrey’s thoughts\nabout “done” at the moment he asked differed from those of the developers;\nand the only way we know to unearth this kind of misalignment is to ask\nquestions like, “What exactly do you mean by ‘done’?”*\n\n“Done” is one important word, the meaning of which you’ll want to discuss\nand clarify for the Commitment Conversation, but there are likely to be many\nothers. For instance, it’s notoriously hard to capture the target behavior of a\ncomplicated software feature like, say, price calculation: “It’s $5 per square\nmeter, except for the granite nish which is $6.

Notice that we didn’t say that in Jeffrey’s case the team should agree on a\nsingle, public denition of done (DoD), an Agile practice particularly used by\nScrum teams. We certainly think that a denition of done can be very helpful,\nand it might have indeed assisted Jeffrey and his team, but it doesn’t give a\nguarantee against commitment miscommunication. For instance, the team\nmight have dened “done” as “passes all unit tests, product manager veries\nfunctionality, code in production,” and by this denition the login screen was\ndone. e problem was, as always, an interpersonal one; Jeffrey’s thoughts\nabout “done” at the moment he asked differed from those of the developers;\nand the only way we know to unearth this kind of misalignment is to ask\nquestions like, “What exactly do you mean by ‘done’?”*\n\n“Done” is one important word, the meaning of which you’ll want to discuss\nand clarify for the Commitment Conversation, but there are likely to be many\nothers. For instance, it’s notoriously hard to capture the target behavior of a\ncomplicated software feature like, say, price calculation: “It’s $5 per square\nmeter, except for the granite nish which is $6.

Obstacles to the Commitment Conversation\n\ne steps seem straightforward---but obstacles are waiting to trip you up. e rst obstacle is cultural: the idea that voluntary commitment is\nvaluable may be a threatening, unwelcome concept in your environment. Where this is the case, compliance is the order of the day, because managers\nprefer the illusion that all they need is for their staff to do what they have been\nasked. After all, they don’t have to ask for commitment from machines. And\nthinking of humans as a kind of machine makes the job of management much\nsimpler, as we pointed out in Chapter 1: you needn’t confront the fact that\nyour team doesn’t trust you, or that you fear it won’t do the job well, or any\nnumber of other messy problems that come with those pesky humans. Management is indeed much simpler if we believe that people doing what\nthey’re told is enough. It is easier to staff projects if we consider developers to\nbe interchangeable resources, one of whom can be instantly and painlessly\nsubstituted for another. It is even easier if we believe a single engineer can\ndivide her time efficiently among two, three, or even more projects! ese\nbeliefs about substitutability and frictionless task-switching t the Taylorist,\nperson-as-machine model. However, humans aren’t like that, and admitting as\nmuch might undercut the basis of the management culture, forcing us to\nconfront difficult interpersonal issues that would just be easier to ignore. If you suspect you have a cultural bias against commitment, or if you\nencounter resistance that shows this bias does exist, you aren’t ready for the\nCommitment Conversation. Return to earlier chapters to address the issues of\nTrust, Fear, and Why that underlie this resistance rst, and then you will nd\nthe conversation itself much easier to hold. e second obstacle, paradoxically, is the existing commitment process your\nteam uses, which may be sprint planning, detailed design documents, or simply\nnodding when the boss gives you a deadline.

Obstacles to the Commitment Conversation\n\ne steps seem straightforward---but obstacles are waiting to trip you up. e rst obstacle is cultural: the idea that voluntary commitment is\nvaluable may be a threatening, unwelcome concept in your environment. Where this is the case, compliance is the order of the day, because managers\nprefer the illusion that all they need is for their staff to do what they have been\nasked. After all, they don’t have to ask for commitment from machines. And\nthinking of humans as a kind of machine makes the job of management much\nsimpler, as we pointed out in Chapter 1: you needn’t confront the fact that\nyour team doesn’t trust you, or that you fear it won’t do the job well, or any\nnumber of other messy problems that come with those pesky humans. Management is indeed much simpler if we believe that people doing what\nthey’re told is enough. It is easier to staff projects if we consider developers to\nbe interchangeable resources, one of whom can be instantly and painlessly\nsubstituted for another. It is even easier if we believe a single engineer can\ndivide her time efficiently among two, three, or even more projects! ese\nbeliefs about substitutability and frictionless task-switching t the Taylorist,\nperson-as-machine model. However, humans aren’t like that, and admitting as\nmuch might undercut the basis of the management culture, forcing us to\nconfront difficult interpersonal issues that would just be easier to ignore. If you suspect you have a cultural bias against commitment, or if you\nencounter resistance that shows this bias does exist, you aren’t ready for the\nCommitment Conversation. Return to earlier chapters to address the issues of\nTrust, Fear, and Why that underlie this resistance rst, and then you will nd\nthe conversation itself much easier to hold. e second obstacle, paradoxically, is the existing commitment process your\nteam uses, which may be sprint planning, detailed design documents, or simply\nnodding when the boss gives you a deadline.

Time for a final check\non the plan and the commitment. Nash: We don’t have to be; we can replan as we\ngo, and we’ll learn more as we start to use the\nnew setup. Am I right you’d all be comfortable\ncommitting to a two-month partial roadmap\nwith weekly deliveries? Well, I didn’t get certain delivery by Christmas,\nbut a clearly committed team with a clear plan\nto execute is a pretty good alternative. All: Yes! Nash would have been most happy with an immediate, condent\ncommitment to Christmas delivery of all seven servers. He was pleased,\nthough, that the culture of psychological safety they’d worked to build meant\nthe team could tell him this wasn’t realistic. e Walking Skeleton alternative\nlooks promising (as it often does for DevOps challenges), but it may require\nsome intervention from him to get clearance for incremental deployments---a\nreciprocal commitment Nash makes to the team that he wouldn’t have known\nwas necessary without the Commitment Conversation. e Walking Skeleton\nlets the team work to a set of incremental milestones that are much easier to\ncommit to, and this gives Nash enough to get other teams started. It’s a\nscenario where everybody wins! Julie and Erik:\nCommitting to a New Process\n\nJulie says, “Recently, I’ve been nding it really hard to work with Erik, who is\nthe CEO and my boss. He likes participating in decisions like which feature\nwe’ll build next or whether to hire another developer, but sometimes it seems\nto me that getting involved at a low level isn’t very efficient for him or healthy\nfor my team.

The Road Never Ends\n\nAs we argued throughout this book, a conversational transformation is the\nway out of the feature factory that traps so many Agile, Lean, and DevOps\nteams. Now that you know this, we’re sure you will drive many\nconversational transformations in teams and organizations you work in. is means you will have the opportunity to keep improving your\nconversation technique throughout your life. As with any other skill, such\nas playing an instrument or practicing a sport, continued practice allows us\nto perform with more grace and style. It also challenges us by showing us\nthat further improvement is always possible. Even after studying these\nmethods for over ten years, both of us continue to make and discover new\nmistakes, which also allows us to learn new skills and invent new\ntechniques. In the morning, we may have a wonderful, relationshipbuilding conversation, but that afternoon, we may stumble through an\nacrimonious discussion that\nleaves everyone frustrated. We have\nexperienced the real value in continuing to practice methods like\nconversational analysis, and even more value in patient friends willing to\npractice and role play with us. e failed conversations may be painful, but\nthey give us the greatest opportunity to develop our most important skills.", "tokens": 414, "metadata": {"source_file": "Agile_Conversations_-_Douglas_SquirrelJeffrey_Fredrick.pdf", "page_num": 238, "segment_id": "00238", "chapter_num": "5", "chapter_title": "e Why Conversation", "section_num": null, "section_title": null, "has_table": false}, "context": "Source: Agile_Conversations_-_Douglas_SquirrelJeffrey_Fredrick.pdf | Chapter 5: e Why Conversation", "chunk_id": "00000224"}
