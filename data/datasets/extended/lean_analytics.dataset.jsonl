To\nbe honest, in far too many of my companies, the accounting was incredibly\nsimple anyway: revenue, margins, free cash flows---they were all zero.\n\nBut accounting is at the heart of our modern management techniques.\nSince the days of Frederick Winslow Taylor, we have assessed the skill of\nmanagers by comparing their results to the forecast. Beat the plan, get a\npromotion. Miss the plan, and your stock price declines. And for some\nkinds of products, this works just fine. Accurate forecasting requires a long\nand stable operating history from which to make the forecast. The longer\nand more stable, the more accurate.\n\nAnd yet who really feels like the world is getting more and more stable\nevery day? Whenever conditions change, or we attempt to change them\nby introducing a truly new product, accurate forecasting becomes nearly\nimpossible. And without that yardstick, how do we evaluate if we’re\nmaking progress? If we’re busy building the wrong product, why should\nwe be proud to be doing it on time and on budget? This is the reason we\nneed a new understanding of how to measure progress, both for ourselves\nas entrepreneurs and managers, as investors in the companies we fund, and\nthe teams under our purview.\n\nThat is why an accounting revolution is required if we’re to succeed in\nthis new era of work. And Ben and Alistair have done the incredibly hard\nwork of surveying the best thinking on the metrics and analytics, gathering\nin-depth examples, and breaking new ground in presenting their own\nframeworks for figuring out which metrics matter, and when. Their work\ncollecting industry-wide benchmarks to use for a variety of key metrics is\nworth the price of admission all by itself.\n\nThis is not a theoretical work, but a guide for all practitioners who seek\nnew sources of growth.

Instincts are experiments. Data is proof.\n\nthe Lean Startup Movement\n\nInnovation is hard work---harder than most people realize. This is true\nwhether you’re a lone startup trying to disrupt an industry or a rogue\nemployee challenging the status quo, tilting at corporate windmills and\nsteering around bureaucratic roadblocks. We get it. Entrepreneurship is\ncrazy, bordering on absurd.\n\nLean Startup provides a framework by which you can more rigorously\ngo about the business of creating something new. Lean Startup delivers a\nheavy dose of intellectual honesty. Follow the Lean model, and it becomes\nincreasingly hard to lie, especially to yourself.\n\nThere’s a reason the Lean Startup movement has taken off now. We’re in the\nmidst of a fundamental shift in how companies are built. It’s vanishingly\ncheap to create the first version of something. Clouds are free. Social media\nis free. Competitive research is free. Even billing and transactions are free.*\nWe live in a digital world, and the bits don’t cost anything.\n\nThat means you can build something, measure its effect, and learn from it\nto build something better the next time. You can iterate quickly, deciding\nearly on if you should double down on your idea or fold and move on to\nthe next one. And that’s where analytics comes in. Learning doesn’t happen\naccidentally. It’s an integral part of the Lean process.\n\nManagement guru and author Peter Drucker famously observed, “If you\ncan’t measure it, you can’t manage it.”† Nowhere is this truer than in the\nLean model, where successful entrepreneurs build the product, the go-tomarket strategy, and the systems by which to learn what customers want---\nsimultaneously.\n\n* when we say “free,” we mean “free from significant upfront investment.” Plenty of cloud and\nbilling services cost money---sometimes more money than you’d spend doing it yourself---\nonce your business is under way.

Being able to compare a metric to other\ntime periods, groups of users, or competitors helps you understand which\nway things are moving. “Increased conversion from last week” is more\nmeaningful than “2% conversion.”\n\nA good metric is understandable.

{"segment_id": "00036", "page_num": 36, "segment": "A good metric is a ratio or a rate. Accountants and financial analysts have\nseveral ratios they look at to understand, at a glance, the fundamental\nhealth of a company.* You need some, too.\n\nThere are several reasons ratios tend to be the best metrics:\n\n• Ratios are easier to act on. Think about driving a car. Distance travelled\nis informational. But speed---distance per hour---is something you can\nact on, because it tells you about your current state, and whether you\nneed to go faster or slower to get to your destination on time.\n\n• Ratios are inherently comparative. If you compare a daily metric to\nthe same metric over a month, you’ll see whether you’re looking at a\nsudden spike or a long-term trend. In a car, speed is one metric, but\nspeed right now over average speed this hour shows you a lot about\nwhether you’re accelerating or slowing down.\n\n• Ratios are also good for comparing factors that are somehow opposed,\nor for which there’s an inherent tension. In a car, this might be distance\ncovered divided by traffic tickets. The faster you drive, the more\ndistance you cover---but the more tickets you get. This ratio might\nsuggest whether or not you should be breaking the speed limit.\n\nLeaving our car analogy for a moment, consider a startup with free and\npaid versions of its software. The company has a choice to make: offer a\nrich set of features for free to acquire new users, or reserve those features\nfor paying customers, so they will spend money to unlock them. Having a\nfull-featured free product might reduce sales, but having a crippled product\nmight reduce new users. You need a metric that combines the two, so you\ncan understand how changes affect overall health. Otherwise, you might\ndo something that increases sales revenue at the expense of growth.\n\nA good metric changes the way you behave. This is by far the most\nimportant criterion for a metric: what will you do differently based on\nchanges in the metric?\n\n• “Accounting” metrics like daily sales revenue, when entered into your\nspreadsheet, need to make your predictions more accurate. These\nmetrics form the basis of Lean Startup’s innovation accounting,\nshowing you how close you are to an ideal model and whether your\nactual results are converging on your business plan.\n\n* this includes fundamentals such as the price-to-earnings ratio, sales margins, the cost of sales,\n\nrevenue per employee, and so on.\n\n10\n\nPArt one: StoP LYIng to YoUrSeLF", "source_file": "Lean_Analytics.pdf", "extraction_method": "pdfminer", "ocr_used": false, "has_table": false, "chapter_num": null, "chapter_title": null, "section_num": null, "section_title": null, "l1_summary": "A good metric is a ratio or a rate. • Ratios are easier to act on.

Changes in these metrics will significantly\nchange your behavior.

They’ll want to know about your\nexperience at the dealership. It’s a quick thing, won’t take you more than a\nminute or two. It’s on a scale from 1 to 5. You’ll give us a 5, right? Nothing\nin the experience would warrant less, right? If so, I’m very, very sorry, but\na 5 would be great.”\n\nBen didn’t give it a lot of thought (and strangely, no one ever did call). Seth\nwould call this a false metric, because the car salesman spent more time\nasking for a good rating (which was clearly important to him) than he did\nproviding a great experience, which was supposedly what the rating was\nfor in the first place.\n\nMisguided sales teams do this too. At one company, Alistair saw a sales\nexecutive tie quarterly compensation to the number of deals in the pipeline,\nrather than to the number of deals closed, or to margin on those sales.\nSalespeople are coin-operated, so they did what they always do: they\nfollowed the money. In this case, that meant a glut of junk leads that took\ntwo quarters to clean out of the pipeline---time that would have been far\nbetter spent closing qualified prospects.\n\nOf course, customer satisfaction or pipeline flow is vital to a successful\nbusiness.

The\ntiming was perfect: Facebook became an open, viral place to acquire\nusers as quickly as possible and build a startup. There had never been\na platform with so many users and that was so open (Facebook had\nabout 50 million users at the time).\n\nBy mid-2008, Circle of Friends had 10 million users. Mike focused on\ngrowth above everything else. “It was a land grab,” he says, and Circle\nof Friends was clearly viral. But there was a problem. Too few people\nwere actually using the product.\n\nAccording to Mike, less than 20% of circles had any activity whatsoever\nafter their initial creation. “We had a few million monthly uniques\nfrom those 10 million users, but as a general social network we knew\nthat wasn’t good enough and monetization would likely be poor.”\n\nSo Mike went digging.\n\nHe started looking through the database of users and what they were\ndoing. The company didn’t have an in-depth analytical dashboard at\nthe time, but Mike could still do some exploratory analysis. And he\nfound a segment of users---moms, to be precise---that bucked the poor\nengagement trend of most users. Here’s what he found:\n\n• Their messages to one another were on average 50% longer.\n\n• They were 115% more likely to attach a picture to a post they\n\nwrote.\n\n• They were 110% more likely to engage in a threaded (i.e., deep)\n\nconversation.\n\n• They had friends who, once invited, were 50% more likely to\n\nbecome engaged users themselves.\n\n• They were 75% more likely to click on Facebook notifications.\n\n• They were 180% more likely to click on Facebook news feed items.\n\n• They were 60% more likely to accept invitations to the app.\n\nCHAPter 2: How to KeeP SCore\n\n17", "source_file": "Lean_Analytics.pdf", "extraction_method": "pdfminer", "ocr_used": false, "has_table": false, "chapter_num": null, "chapter_title": null, "section_num": null, "section_title": null, "l1_summary": "There had never been\na platform with so many users and that was so open (Facebook had\nabout 50 million users at the time).

{"segment_id": "00045", "page_num": 45, "segment": "If the current number of prospects is very small, you’re not likely to add\nmany new customers. You can increase the number of prospects and expect\nan increase in new customers.\n\nOn the other hand, a lagging metric, such as churn (which is the number\nof customers who leave in a given time period) gives you an indication\nthat there’s a problem---but by the time you’re able to collect the data and\nidentify the problem, it’s too late. The customers who churned out aren’t\ncoming back. That doesn’t mean you can’t act on a lagging metric (i.e.,\nwork to improve churn and then measure it again), but it’s akin to closing\nthe barn door after the horses have left. New horses won’t leave, but you’ve\nalready lost a few.\n\nIn the early days of your startup, you won’t have enough data to know how\na current metric relates to one down the road, so measure lagging metrics\nat first. Lagging metrics are still useful and can provide a solid baseline\nof performance. For leading indicators to work, you need to be able to do\ncohort analysis and compare groups of customers over periods of time.\n\nConsider, for example, the volume of customer complaints. You might\ntrack the number of support calls that happen in a day---once you’ve got a\ncall volume to make that useful. Earlier on, you might track the number of\ncustomer complaints in a 90-day period. Both could be leading indicators\nof churn: if complaints are increasing, it’s likely that more customers\nwill stop using your product or service. As a leading indicator, customer\ncomplaints also give you ammunition to dig into what’s going on, figure out\nwhy customers are complaining more, and address those issues.\n\nNow consider account cancellation or product returns. Both are important\nmetrics---but they measure after the fact. They pinpoint problems, but only\nafter it’s too late to avert the loss of a customer. Churn is important (and\nwe discuss it at length throughout the book), but looking at it myopically\nwon’t let you iterate and adapt at the speed you need.\n\nIndicators are everywhere. In an enterprise software company, quarterly\nnew product bookings are a lagging metric of sales success. By contrast,\nnew qualified leads are a leading indicator, because they let you predict sales\nsuccess ahead of time. But as anyone who’s ever worked in B2B (businessto-business) sales will tell you, in addition to qualified leads you need a\ngood understanding of conversion rate and sales-cycle length. Only then\ncan you make a realistic estimate of how much new business you’ll book.\n\nIn some cases, a lagging metric for one group within a company is a\nleading metric for another. For example, we know that the number of\nquarterly bookings is a lagging metric for salespeople (the contracts are\nsigned already), but for the finance department that’s focused on collecting\n\nCHAPter 2: How to KeeP SCore\n\n19", "source_file": "Lean_Analytics.pdf", "extraction_method": "pdfminer", "ocr_used": false, "has_table": false, "chapter_num": null, "chapter_title": null, "section_num": null, "section_title": null, "l1_summary": "You can increase the number of prospects and expect\nan increase in new customers.

Almost certainly not---softer tires stop poorly on\nwarm summer roads, and accidents would increase.\n\nOther factors, such as the number of hours driven and summer vacations,\nare likely responsible for the increased accident rates. But looking at a simple\ncorrelation without demanding causality leads to some bad decisions.\nThere’s a correlation between ice cream consumption and drowning. Does\nthat mean we should ban ice cream to avert drowning deaths? Or measure\nice cream consumption to predict the fortunes of funeral home stock\nprices? No: ice cream and drowning rates both happen because of summer\nweather.\n\nFinding a correlation between two metrics is a good thing. Correlations\ncan help you predict what will happen. But finding the cause of something\nmeans you can change it. Usually, causations aren’t simple one-to-one\nrelationships. Many factors conspire to cause something. In the case of\nsummertime car crashes, we have to consider alcohol consumption, the\nnumber of inexperienced drivers on the road, the greater number of\ndaylight hours, summer vacations, and so on. So you’ll seldom get a 100%\ncausal relationship. You’ll get several independent metrics, each of which\n“explains” a portion of the behavior of the dependent metric. But even a\ndegree of causality is valuable.\n\nYou prove causality by finding a correlation, then running an experiment\nin which you control the other variables and measure the difference. This\nis hard to do because no two users are identical; it’s often impossible to\nsubject a statistically significant number of people to a properly controlled\nexperiment in the real world.\n\n*\n\n http://www.statcan.gc.ca/pub/82-003-x/2008003/article/10648/c-g/5202438-eng.htm\n\n20\n\nPArt one: StoP LYIng to YoUrSeLF", "source_file": "Lean_Analytics.pdf", "extraction_method": "pdfminer", "ocr_used": false, "has_table": false, "chapter_num": null, "chapter_title": null, "section_num": null, "section_title": null, "l1_summary": "There’s a correlation between ice cream consumption and drowning.

Kids\ncould complete the tasks, collect points, and redeem the points for\nrewards they wanted.\n\nWhen HighScore House launched its MVP, the company had several\nhundred families ready to test it. The founders drew a line in the sand:\nin order for the MVP to be considered successful, parents and kids\nwould have to each use the application four times per week. These\nfamilies would be considered “active.” It was a high, but good, bar.\n\nAfter a month or so, the percentage of active families was lower than\nthis line in the sand. The founders were disappointed but determined to\nkeep experimenting in an effort to improve engagement:\n\n• They modified the sign-up flow (making it clearer and more\neducational to increase quality signups and to improve onboarding).\n\n• They sent email notifications as daily reminders to parents.\n\n• They sent transactional emails to parents based on actions their\n\nkids took in the system.\n\nThere was an incremental improvement each time, but nothing that\nmoved the needle significantly enough to say that the MVP was a\nsuccess.\n\nThen co-founder and CEO Kyle Seaman did something critical: he\npicked up the phone. Kyle spoke with dozens of parents. He started\ncalling parents who had signed up, but who weren’t active. First he\nreached out to those that had abandoned HighScore House completely\n(“churned out”). For many of them, the application wasn’t solving a big\nenough pain point. That’s fine. The founders never assumed the market\nwas “all parents”---that’s just too broad a definition, particularly for\na first version of a product. Kyle was looking for a smaller subset of\nfamilies where HighScore House would resonate, to narrow the market\nsegment and focus.\n\nKyle then called those families who were using HighScore House, but\nnot using it enough to be defined as active. Many of these families\nresponded positively: “We’re using HighScore House. It’s great.

There’s no substitute for engaging with\ncustomers and users directly. All the numbers in the world can’t explain\nwhy something is happening.

Lower\nthe bar if necessary, but not for the sake of getting over it: that’s just\ncheating.

{"segment_id": "00050", "page_num": 50, "segment": "Segments, Cohorts, A/B testing, and Multivariate\nAnalysis\n\nTesting is at the heart of Lean Analytics. Testing usually involves comparing\ntwo things against each other through segmentation, cohort analysis, or\nA/B testing. These are important concepts for anyone trying to perform the\nkind of scientific comparison needed to justify a change, so we’ll explain\nthem in some detail here.\n\nSegmentation\n\nA segment is simply a group that shares some common characteristic. It\nmight be users who run Firefox, or restaurant patrons who make reservations\nrather than walking in, or passengers who buy first-class tickets, or parents\nwho drive minivans.\n\nOn websites, you segment visitors according to a range of technical and\ndemographic information, then compare one segment to another. If visitors\nusing the Firefox browser have significantly fewer purchases, do additional\ntesting to find out why. If a disproportionate number of engaged users\nare coming from Australia, survey them to discover why, and then try to\nreplicate that success in other markets.\n\nSegmentation works for any industry and any form of marketing, not just\nfor websites. Direct mail marketers have been segmenting for decades with\ngreat success.\n\nCohort Analysis\n\nA second kind of analysis, which compares similar groups over time, is\ncohort analysis. As you build and test your product, you’ll iterate constantly.\nUsers who join you in the first week will have a different experience from\nthose who join later on. For example, all of your users might go through an\ninitial free trial, usage, payment, and abandonment cycle. As this happens,\nyou’ll make changes to your business model. The users who experienced the\ntrial in month one will have a different onboarding experience from those\nwho experience it in month five. How did that affect their churn? To find\nout, we use cohort analysis.\n\nEach group of users is a cohort---participants in an experiment across their\nlifecycle. You can compare cohorts against one another to see if, on the\nwhole, key metrics are getting better over time. Here’s an example of why\ncohort analysis is critical for startups.\n\n24\n\nPArt one: StoP LYIng to YoUrSeLF", "source_file": "Lean_Analytics.pdf", "extraction_method": "pdfminer", "ocr_used": false, "has_table": false, "chapter_num": null, "chapter_title": null, "section_num": null, "section_title": null, "l1_summary": "Segments, Cohorts, A/B testing, and Multivariate\nAnalysis Users who join you in the first week will have a different experience from\nthose who join later on.

This is about\nyour ability to satisfy your market’s need better than your competitors,\nand it’s a combination of design skill, coding, branding, and myriad other\nfactors. If you identify a real need, you won’t be the only one satisfying\nit, and you’ll need all the talent you can muster in order to succeed. Do\nyou have a network of friends and contacts who can give you an unfair\nadvantage that improves your odds? Do you have the talent to do the things\nthat matter really well? Never start a company on a level playing field---\nthat’s where everyone else is standing.\n\nThese same rules apply to people working in larger organizations. Don’t\nlaunch a new product or enter a new market unless your existing product\nand market affords you an unfair advantage. Young competitors with fewer\nlegacies will be fighting you for market share, and your size should be an\nadvantage, not a handicap.\n\nSecond, figure out whether you like doing this thing. Startups will consume\nyour life, and they’ll be a constant source of aggravation. Your business will\ncompete with your friends, your partner, your children, and your hobbies.\nYou need to believe in what you’re doing so that you’ll keep at it and ride\nthrough the good times and the bad. Would you work on it even if you\nweren’t being paid? Is it a problem worth solving, that you’ll brag about to\nothers? Is it something that will take your career in the direction you want,\nand give you the right reputation within your existing organization? If not,\nmaybe you should keep looking.\n\nFinally, be sure you can make money doing it.* This is about the market’s\nneed. You have to be able to extract enough money from customers for\nthe value you’ll deliver, and do so without spending a lot to acquire those\ncustomers---and the process of acquiring them and extracting their money\nhas to scale independent of you as a founder.\n\nFor an intrapreneur, this question needs to be answered simply to get\napproval for the project, but remember that you’re fighting the opportunity\ncost---whatever the organization could be doing instead, or the profitability\nof the existing business. If what you’re doing isn’t likely to have a material\nimpact on the bottom line, maybe you should look elsewhere.\n\nThis is by far the most important of the three; the other two are easy,\nbecause they’re up to you.

Left to its own devices, the\nsoftware quickly learned that scantily clad women generated a far higher\nclick-through rate on web pages than other forms of content. But that\nclick-through rate was a short-term gain, offset by damage to the brand\nof the company that relied on it.

{"segment_id": "00073", "page_num": 73, "segment": "Eric Ries’s Engines of growth\n\nIn Lean Startup, Eric Ries talks about three engines that drive the growth of\na startup. Each of these has associated key performance indicators (KPIs).\n\nSticky Engine\n\nThe sticky engine focuses on getting users to return, and to keep using your\nproduct. It’s akin to Dave McClure’s retention phase. If your users aren’t\nsticky, churn will be high, and you won’t have engagement. Engagement is\none of the best predictors of success: Facebook’s early user counts weren’t\nhuge, but the company could get nearly all students in a university to use\nthe product, and to keep coming back, within a few months of launch.\nFacebook’s stickiness was off the charts.\n\nThe fundamental KPI for stickiness is customer retention. Churn rates and\nusage frequency are other important metrics to track. Long-term stickiness\noften comes from the value users create for themselves as they use the\nservice. It’s hard for people to leave Gmail or Evernote, because, well, that’s\nwhere they store all their stuff. Similarly, if a player deletes his account\nfrom a massively multiplayer online game (MMO), he loses all his status\nand in-game items, which he’s worked hard to earn.\n\nStickiness isn’t only about retention, it’s also about frequency, which is why\nyou also need to track metrics like time since last visit. If you have methods\nof driving return visits such as email notifications or updates, then email\nopen rates and click-through rates matter, too.\n\nVirality Engine\n\nVirality is all about getting the word out. Virality is attractive because it\ncompounds---if every user adds another 1.5 users, your user base will grow\ninfinitely until you’ve saturated all users.*\n\nThe key metric for this engine is the viral coefficient---the number of new\nusers that each user brings on. Because this is compounding (the users they\nbring, in turn, bring their own users), the metric measures how many users\nare brought in with each viral cycle. Growth comes from a viral coefficient\nof greater than one, but you also have to factor in churn and loss. The\nbigger the coefficient, the faster you grow.\n\n*\n\nIt’s never really this simple; churn, competitors, and other factors mean it’s not really infinite,\nof course.\n\nCHAPter 5 : AnALYtICS FrAMeworKS\n\n47", "source_file": "Lean_Analytics.pdf", "extraction_method": "pdfminer", "ocr_used": false, "has_table": false, "chapter_num": null, "chapter_title": null, "section_num": null, "section_title": null, "l1_summary": "The sticky engine focuses on getting users to return, and to keep using your\nproduct.

{"segment_id": "00074", "page_num": 74, "segment": "Measuring viral coefficient isn’t enough. You also need to measure the\nactions that make up the cycle. For example, when you join most social\nnetworks, you’re asked to connect to your email account to find contacts,\nthen you’re given the option to invite them. They receive emails, which\nthey might act upon. Those distinct stages all contribute to virality, so\nmeasuring actions is how you tweak the viral engine---by changing the\nmessage, simplifying the signup process, and so on.\n\nThere are other factors at play with virality as well, including the speed\nwith which a user invites another (known as the viral cycle time) and the\ntype of virality. We’ll dive into these later in the book.\n\nPaid Engine\n\nThe third engine of growth is payment. It’s usually premature to turn this\nengine on before you know that your product is sticky and viral. Meteor\nEntertainment’s Hawken is a multiplayer game that’s free to play, but it\nmakes money from in-game upgrades. Meteor is focusing on usage within\na beta group first (stickiness), then working on virality (inviting your\nfriends to play), and finally payment (players buying upgrades to become\ncompetitive or enhance the in-game experience).\n\nGetting paid is, in some ways, the ultimate metric for identifying a\nsustainable business model. If you make more money from customers\nthan it costs you to acquire them---and you do so consistently---you’re\nsustainable. You don’t need money from external investors, and you’re\ngrowing shareholder equity every day.\n\nBut getting paid, on its own, isn’t an engine of growth. It’s just a way to put\nmoney in the bank. Revenue helps growth only when you funnel some of\nthe money generated from revenue back into acquisition. Then you have a\nmachine that you can tune to grow the business over time.\n\nThe two knobs on this machine are customer lifetime value (CLV) and\ncustomer acquisition cost (CAC). Making more money from customers\nthan you spend acquiring them is good, but the equation for success isn’t\nthat simple. You still need to worry about cash flow and growth rate, which\nare driven by how long it takes a customer to pay off. One way to measure\nthis is time to customer breakeven---that is, how much time it will take to\nrecoup the acquisition cost of a customer.\n\nAsh Maurya’s Lean Canvas\n\nWe looked at the Lean Canvas in Chapter 3, when we talked about deciding\nwhat problem you should solve.

They often\nuse the pivot as an enabler for chronic ADD, rather than as a way to iterate\nthrough ideas in a methodical fashion.\n\nBut one of the keys to startup success is achieving real focus and having\nthe discipline to maintain it. You may succeed if you’re unfocused, but it’ll\nbe by accident. You’ll spend a lot more time wandering aimlessly, and the\nlessons learned are more painful and harder-won.

We’re not saying that there’s only one metric\nyou care about from the day you wake up with an idea to the day you sell\nyour company. We are, however, saying that at any given time, there’s one\nmetric you should care about above all else. Boiled down to its very essence,\nLean Startup is really about getting you to focus on the right thing, at the\nright time, with the right mindset.\n\nAs noted in Chapter 5, Eric Ries talks about three engines that drive\ncompany growth: the sticky engine, the viral engine, and the paid engine.\nBut he cautions that while all successful companies will ultimately use all\nthree engines, it’s better to focus on one engine at a time. For example, you\nmight make your product sticky for its core users, then use that to grow\nvirally, and then use the user base to grow revenue. That’s focus.\n\nIn the world of analytics and data, this means picking a single metric that’s\nincredibly important for the step you’re currently working through in your\nstartup.

We also have a\nhuge screen up in the office pumping out customer counts and free trial\ncounts.

If they didn’t know what it was, if it was the wrong\nmetric for their stage, if they had several metrics, or if they didn’t know\nwhat the current value was, we knew something was wrong.\n\nPicking the OMTM lets you run more controlled experiments quickly\nand compare the results more effectively. Remember: the One Metric\nThat Matters changes over time. When you’re focused on acquiring users\n(and converting them into customers), your OMTM may be tied to which\nacquisition channels are working best or the conversion rate from signup\nto active user. When you’re focused on retention, you may be looking at\nchurn, and experimenting with pricing, features, improving customer\nsupport, and so on. The OMTM changes depending on your current stage,\nand in some cases it will change quickly.\n\nLet’s look at four reasons why you should use the One Metric That Matters.\n\n• It answers the most important question you have. At any given time,\nyou’ll be trying to answer a hundred different questions and juggling a\nmillion things. You need to identify the riskiest areas of your business\nas quickly as possible, and that’s where the most important question\nlies. When you know what the right question is, you’ll know what\nmetric to track in order to answer that question. That’s the OMTM.\n\n• It forces you to draw a line in the sand and have clear goals. After\nyou’ve identified the key problem on which you want to focus, you need\nto set goals. You need a way of defining success.\n\n• It focuses the entire company. Avinash Kaushik has a name for trying\nto report too many things: data puking.* Nobody likes puke. Use\nthe OMTM as a way of focusing your entire company. Display your\nOMTM prominently through web dashboards, on TV screens, or in\nregular emails.\n\n• It inspires a culture of experimentation. By now you should appreciate\nthe importance of experimentation. It’s critical to move through the\nbuild→measure→learn cycle as quickly and as frequently as possible.\nTo succeed at that, you need to actively encourage experimentation.\nIt will lead to small-f failures, but you can’t punish that. Quite the\nopposite: failure that comes from planned, methodical testing is simply\nhow you learn. It moves things forward in the end.

It’s useful because it combines two things you\nhave a degree of control over---per-diner revenues and staffing costs.”\n\nRandy explained when staffing costs exceed 30% of gross revenues,\nthat’s bad, because it means that you’re either spending too much on\nstaff or not deriving enough revenue per customer. A Michelin-starred\nrestaurant can afford to have more staff, and pay them more, because it\nsells customers expensive wines and enjoys good per-customer revenue.\nAt the other end of the spectrum, a low-margin casual dining restaurant\nhas to keep staff costs down.\n\nThe ratio works because it’s:\n\n• Simple: It’s a single number.\n\n• Immediate: You can generate it every night.\n\n• Actionable: You can change staffing, or encourage upselling, the\nvery next day, whereas ingredient costs, menus, or leasing take\nlonger to modify.\n\n• Comparable: You can track it over time, and compare it to other\n\nrestaurants in your category.\n\n• Fundamental: It reflects two basic facets of the restaurant business\n\nmodel.\n\nAs it turns out, 24% is about right.

And if you don’t hit the target, you\nneed to go back to the drawing board and try again.\n\nPicking the target number for any given metric is extremely hard. We’ve\nseen many startups struggle with this. Often, they avoid picking a number\naltogether. Unfortunately, this means it’s difficult to know what to do\nonce an experiment is completed. If, in our example, the user acquisition\nexperiment is a dismal failure, any number you had picked beforehand\nis probably immaterial; you’ll know it’s a failure. And if your efforts are\ninsanely successful, you’re going to know that as well. It’ll be obvious. But\nmost of the time, experiments end up right in the big fat middle.

That’s\nthe trickiest spot to be in.\n\nThere are two right answers to the question of what success looks like. The\nfirst comes from your business model, which may tell you what a metric\nhas to be. If you know that you need 10% of your users to sign up for the\npaid version of your site in order to meet your business targets, then that’s\nyour number.\n\nIn the early stages of your business, however, you’re still figuring out what\nyour business model should look like. It won’t tell you precisely what you\nneed. The second right answer is to look at what’s normal or ideal. Knowing\nan industry baseline means you know what’s likely to happen, and you can\ncompare yourself to it. In the absence of any other information, this is a\ngood place to start. We’ll share some industry benchmarks that may be\nhelpful to you later in the book.\n\nthe Squeeze toy\n\nThere’s another important aspect to the OMTM.

It can include transactions, subscriptions, consumption-based\nbilling charges, ad revenue, resale of data, donations, and much more.\n\n• The product type is what value your business offers in return for the\n\nrevenue.\n\nCHAPter 7: wHAt BUSIneSS Are YoU In?\n\n67", "source_file": "Lean_Analytics.pdf", "extraction_method": "pdfminer", "ocr_used": false, "has_table": false, "chapter_num": null, "chapter_title": null, "section_num": null, "section_title": null, "l1_summary": "the Business Model Flipbook In the same way, a business model is a combination of things.

This is the traditional “conversion funnel” from\nwhich mainstream analytics packages like Omniture and Google Analytics\nemerged.\n\nBut modern e-commerce is seldom this simple:\n\n• The majority of buyers find what they’re looking for through search\nrather than by navigating across a series of pages.

Loyalty programs aren’t good long-term investments for this kind of business.\nKevin says that 70% of e-commerce businesses fall into this category when they’re mature. Vendors of scuba or rock climbing\nequipment might be a great example of this: many of their customers buy gear once, and don’t get so hooked on the hobby that they\nneed to upgrade. That’s not a bad thing---it just dictates marketing\nstrategy. An online vendor of eyewear might put more of its marketing efforts into convincing past buyers to refer others, and less\ninto convincing those buyers to purchase multiple pairs of glasses,\nfor example.\n\nHybrid mode\n\nIf 40--60% of last year’s buyers will buy this year, then the company will grow with a mix of new customers and returning customers.

It’s one of the first metrics you use to assess how you’re doing.\nIt’s simple to calculate and experiment with. You’ll slice conversion rate\nin many ways---by demographics, by copy, by referral, and so on---to see\nwhat makes people more likely to buy.\n\nEarly on, conversion rate may even be more important than total revenue\nbecause your initial goal is to simply prove that someone will buy\nsomething (and it gives you that person’s email address and data on what\nhe purchases). But there’s also a risk in focusing too intensely on conversion\nrate. Conversion rate is highly dependent on your type of e-commerce\nbusiness, and whether your success will be driven by loyalty, new customer\nacquisition, or a hybrid of the two.\n\nPurchases Per year\n\nWhile conversion rate is important, it doesn’t tell the whole story. There are\nmany examples of e-commerce sites with high or low conversion rates that\nare successful. It depends on the type of e-commerce site and how people\nbuy. A store that sells coffins probably sells only one per lifetime; a grocery\nstore sells to a customer several times a week.\n\nIf you look at the repurchase rate on a 90-day cycle, it becomes a very good\nleading indicator for what type of e-commerce site you have. There’s no\nright or wrong answer, but it is important to know whether to focus more\non loyalty or more on acquisition.\n\nShopping Cart Size\n\nThe other half of the conversion rate equation is the size of the shopping\ncart. Not only do you want to know what percentage of people bought\nsomething, you also want to know how much they spent. You may find that\none campaign is more likely to make people buy, but another might make\nfewer people spend more money.\n\nIn practice, you’ll compare the total revenue you’re generating to the way\nin which you acquired that revenue, in order to identify the most lucrative\nsegments of your reachable audience. But don’t get too caught up in top-line\nrevenue; profit is what really matters.\n\nBill D’Alessandro of Skyway Ventures, a private investment firm focused\non e-commerce companies, says, “The key to successful e-commerce is in\nincreasing shopping cart size; that’s really where the money is made.

But a purchasing process often has several\nsteps---reviewing items in a shopping cart, providing shipping information,\nentering billing details, and so on. In some cases, the process may even\ninvolve a third-party site: Kickstarter sends users to Amazon to provide\ntheir credit card information, and Eventbrite links to PayPal so buyers can\npay for tickets.\n\nThe number of people who abandon a funnel at each of these stages is the\nabandonment rate.

E-commerce sites are simple math: make more from selling things than\nit costs you to find buyers and deliver the goods.\n\nAccounting for the cost of acquisition in aggregate is fairly easy; it’s more\ncomplicated when you have myriad channels driving traffic to your site.\nThe good news is that analytics tools were literally built to do this for you.\nThe reason Google has a free analytics product is because the company\nmakes money from relevant advertising, and wants to make it as easy as\npossible for you to buy ads and measure their effectiveness.\n\nRevenue Per Customer\n\nRevenue per customer (or lifetime value) is important for all types of\ne-commerce businesses, regardless of whether you’re focused on new\ncustomer acquisition or loyalty (or both). Even if your business doesn’t\nengender loyalty (because you’re selling something that’s infrequently\npurchased), you want to maximize revenue per customer; you do so by\nincreasing shopping cart size and conversion while reducing abandonment.\nRevenue per customer is really an aggregate metric of other key numbers,\nand represents a good, single measure of your e-commerce business’s health.\n\n78\n\nPArt two: FInDIng tHe rIgHt MetrIC For rIgHt now", "source_file": "Lean_Analytics.pdf", "extraction_method": "pdfminer", "ocr_used": false, "has_table": false, "chapter_num": null, "chapter_title": null, "section_num": null, "section_title": null, "l1_summary": "At its simplest, abandonment rate is the\nopposite of conversion rate.

But be sure you’re optimizing the right\nmetric. You don’t just want a high conversion rate---though that’s\ngood. You want high revenue per visitor, or high customer lifetime\nvalue (CLV), because that’s what’s really driving your business model.\n\nKeywords and Search terms\n\nMost people find products by searching for them, whether that’s in a web\nbrowser, on a search engine, or within a site. In each case, you want to\nknow which keywords drive traffic that turns into money.\n\nFor paid search, you’re going to be bidding against others for popular\nkeywords in search engines like Google. Understanding which words\nare a comparatively good “value”---not too expensive, but still able to\ndrive a reasonable amount of traffic---is what search engine marketing\nprofessionals do for a living.\n\nFor unpaid search, you’ll be more focused on good, compelling content\nthat improves your ranking with search engines, and on writing copy that\nincludes the desirable search terms your paying customers tend to use (so\nyou’ll be featured in search results because of your relevance).\n\nYou also want to analyze search within your site. First, you want to be\nsure you have what people are after. If users are searching for something\nand not finding it---or searching, then pressing the back button---that’s a\nsign that you don’t have what they want. Second, if a significant chunk of\nsearches fall into a particular category, that’s a sign that you might want\nto alter your positioning, or add that category to the home page, to see if\nyou can capture more of that market faster. Jason Billingsley, former VP of\nInnovation at Elastic Path, an enterprise e-commerce platform vendor, says,\n“Numbers vary by vertical and by site, but on-site search tools typically\naccount for 5--15% of navigation.”\n\nWe’re not going to get into the details of search engine optimization and\nsearch engine marketing here---those are worlds unto themselves.

Today, these engines are becoming more\nwidespread thanks to third-party recommendation services that work with\nsmaller retailers. Even bloggers have this kind of algorithm, suggesting\nother articles similar to the one the visitor is currently reading.\n\nThere are many different approaches to recommendations. Some use what\nthe buyer has purchased in the past; others try to predict purchases from\nvisitor attributes like geography, referral, or what the visitor has clicked\nso far. Predictive analysis of visitors relies heavily on machine learning,\nand the metrics you’ll track will vary from tool to tool, but they all boil\ndown to one thing: how much additional revenue am I generating through\nrecommendations?\n\nWhen you make adjustments to the recommendation engine, you’ll want to\nsee if you moved the needle in the right direction.\n\nVirality\n\nFor many e-commerce sites, virality is important, because referral and viral\nattention drives cheap, high-value traffic.

That delivery\nmay be electronic, but in most cases, it means moving physical goods\naround. Not only do high shipping costs reduce conversion rates, but\nsuccessful, timely delivery is also a huge factor in buyer satisfaction and\nrepeat purchases. Offline components of any e-commerce business need to\nbe analyzed carefully.\n\nShipping time\n\nReal-time delivery and next-day shipping are increasingly common, and\nbuyers are becoming more demanding. Shipping time is key, and it’s\ntightly linked to how effectively the retailer handles logistics. E-commerce\ncompanies can most likely achieve significant operational efficiencies just\nby optimizing their fulfillment and shipping processes. These efficiencies\nturn into a competitive advantage, because they let you sell to consumers\nwho are more interested in faster, better-quality service than the cheapest\nprice.\n\nStock Availability\n\n“When items are out of stock, sales go down,” says Jason Billingsley. “Of\ncourse that’s obvious, but few e-commerce vendors do anything about it.”\nImproving your inventory management can make a big difference to your\nbottom line. Jason recommends lowering out-of-stock items on product list\nor category pages, effectively hiding them from consumers. You can also\nhide these items from searches, or again, make sure they appear lower in\nthe search results.\n\nIt’s also interesting to analyze inventory versus sales. “A lot of e-commerce\nvendors hold too much inventory for things that don’t sell well, and not\nenough for things that do sell well,” says Jason.

Plenty of services, however, are subscription-based.\nThis complicates things.\n\nSubscription services bill the customer on a regular basis. Churn is easier to\nmeasure---the customer doesn’t renew his account or cancels outright---but\nhappens more dramatically. Rather than a gradual reduction in purchases\nover time, the customer’s revenue simply stops. If this is you, check out\nthe following business model---Software as a Service---because it applies\nto you as well.\n\nPhone companies devote considerable effort to tackling this kind of churn.\nThey build sophisticated models that predict when a subscriber is about\nto cancel her service, and then offer her a new phone or a discount on a\nrenewed contract just before the cancellation happens.\n\nExpired payment information is also a concern for subscriptions. If you\ntry to charge a customer’s credit card for his monthly renewal and the\ntransaction fails, you have to convince him to re-enter payment details.\n\nFrom an analytics perspective, this means tracking additional metrics for\nthe rate of payment expiration, the effectiveness of renewal campaigns, and\nthe factors that help (or hinder) renewal rates. These metrics matter later\non as you’re working to reduce churn, but as the total number of loyal users\ngrows, renewal revenue represents a significant portion of total revenue.\n\nKey takeaways\n\n• It’s vital to know if you’re focused on loyalty or acquisition. This drives\nyour whole marketing strategy and many of the features you build.\n\n• Searches, both off- and on-site, are an increasingly common way of\n\nfinding something for purchase.\n\n• While conversion rates, repeat purchases, and transaction sizes are\nimportant, the ultimate metric is the product of the three of them:\nrevenue per customer.\n\n• Don’t overlook real-world considerations like shipping, warehouse\n\nlogistics, and inventory.\n\nCHAPter 8 : MoDeL one: e-CoMMerCe\n\n87", "source_file": "Lean_Analytics.pdf", "extraction_method": "pdfminer", "ocr_used": false, "has_table": false, "chapter_num": null, "chapter_title": null, "section_num": null, "section_title": null, "l1_summary": "Wrinkles: traditional E-commerce Versus Subscription\nE-commerce Subscription services bill the customer on a regular basis.

The\ncompany was founded in 2008 by Robert May and Vik Chadha, and\nhas gone on to raise $19.5M in several rounds of financing.\n\nBackupify was good at focusing on a specific metric at a specific stage,\nin order to grow the company. “Initially, we focused on site visitors,\nbecause we just wanted to get people to our site,” said CEO and cofounder Robert May. “Then we focused on trials, because we needed\npeople testing out our product.”\n\nOnce Backupify had people trialing the product in sufficient numbers,\nRobert focused on signups (conversions from free trial to paying\ncustomer). Now, the primary focus is monthly recurring revenue (MRR).\n\nThe cloud storage industry has matured a lot in a handful of years,\nbut back in 2008 it was a nascent market. At the time, the company\nwas focused on consumers and realized that, while revenue was going\nup, the customer acquisition cost (CAC) was too high. “In early 2010\nwe were paying $243 to acquire a customer, who only paid us $39\nper year,” explained Robert. “Those are horrible economics. Most\nconsumer apps get around the high acquisition costs with some sort\nof virality, but backup isn’t viral. So we had to pivot [from consumer\nsales] to go after businesses.”\n\nThe pivot for Backupify was a success. The company is growing\nsuccessfully. For now, it remains focused on MRR, but it also tracks\nhow much a customer is worth in the entirety of his relationship with\nthe company---the customer lifetime value (CLV). CLV and CAC are\nthe two essential metrics for a subscription business.\n\nIn Backupify’s case, the ratio of CLV to CAC is 5--6x, meaning that for\nevery dollar the company invests in finding a customer, it makes back\n$5 to $6. This is excellent, and it’s partly due to its low churn. As it\nturns out, lock-in is high for cloud storage, which gives the company\nplenty of time to make back its acquisition costs in the form of revenues.\nWe’ll look at the CAC/CLV ratio in more detail later in the book.\n\n“MRR growth will probably be our top metric until we hit $10M\nin annual recurring revenue,” said Robert. “I watch churn, but I’m\nmore focused on customer acquisition payback in months, which is\nhow quickly I make my money back on each customer.” Robert’s\ntarget for that metric is 12 months or less for any given channel.\nCustomer acquisition payback is a great example of a single number\n\n92\n\nPArt two: FInDIng tHe rIgHt MetrIC For rIgHt now", "source_file": "Lean_Analytics.pdf", "extraction_method": "pdfminer", "ocr_used": false, "has_table": false, "chapter_num": "14", "chapter_title": "to understand how your current stage affects the metrics you", "section_num": null, "section_title": null, "l1_summary": "Case st udy | Backupify’s Customer Lifecycle At the time, the company\nwas focused on consumers and realized that, while revenue was going\nup, the customer acquisition cost (CAC) was too high.

The metrics start by tracking\nquestions like “Does anyone care about this at all?” and then get more\nsophisticated, asking questions like “Can this business actually scale?”\nAs you start to look at more sophisticated metrics, you may realize\nyour business model is fundamentally flawed and unsustainable. Don’t\njust start from scratch: sometimes what you need is a new market, not\na new product, and that market may be closer than you think.\n\nMeasuring Engagement\n\nThe ultimate metric for engagement is daily use. How many of your\ncustomers use your product on a daily basis? If your product isn’t a daily use\napp, establishing a minimum baseline of engagement takes longer, and the\ntime it takes to iterate through a cycle of learning is longer. It’s also hard to\ndemonstrate enough value, quickly enough, to keep people from churning.\nHabits are hard to form---and with any new product, you’re creating new\nhabits, which you want to do as quickly and intensely as possible.\n\nEvernote is an example of a daily use application (at least, its creators\nwould like you to use it on a daily basis!). The people who pay for Evernote\nare most likely those who use it daily.

You also won’t have the\nsame volume of metrics on which to base your decisions.\n\nWhen measuring engagement, don’t just look at a coarse metric like visit\nfrequency. Look for usage patterns throughout your application. For\nexample, it’s interesting to know that people log in three times per week,\nbut what are they actually doing inside your application? What if they’re\nonly spending a few minutes each time? Is that good or bad? Are there\nspecific features they’re using versus others? Is there one feature that they\nalways use, and are there others they never touch? Did they return of their\nown accord, or in response to an email?\n\nFinding these engagement patterns means analyzing data in two ways:\n\n• To find ways you might improve things, segment users who do what\nyou want from those who don’t, and identify ways in which they’re\ndifferent. Do the engaged users all live in the same city? Do all users\nwho eventually become loyal contributors learn about you from one\nsocial network? Are the users who successfully invite friends all under\n30 years old? If you find a concentration of desirable behavior in one\nsegment, you can then target it.\n\n• To decide whether a change worked, test the change on a subset of your\nusers and compare that subset’s results to others. If you put in a new\nreporting feature, reveal it to half of your users, and see if more of them\nstick around for several months. If you can’t test features in this way\nwithout fallout---the customers who didn’t get the new feature might\nget angry---then at the very least, compare the cohort of users who\njoined after the feature was added to those who came before.\n\nA data-driven approach to measuring engagement should show you not\nonly how sticky your product or service is, but also who stuck and whether\nyour efforts are paying off.\n\nChurn\n\nChurn is the percentage of people who abandon your service over time.\nThis can be measured weekly, monthly, quarterly, etc., but you should pick\na timespan for all your metrics and stick to it in order to make comparing\nthem easier. In a freemium or free-trial business model, you have both\nusers (not paid) and customers (paid), and you should track churn for both\ngroups separately.

When\nthey started, founders Ben Baldwin and Jamie Schneiderman offered a\n$99/month (per job posting) package. “We kept hearing over and over\nthat monthly subscriptions were the key to growing a successful SaaS\nbusiness,” says Ben. “So that’s the direction we took, but it didn’t work\nas planned.”\n\nTwo things confused ClearFit’s customers: the price point and the\nmonthly subscription. Ben and Jamie wanted to price ClearFit below\nwhat customers paid for job boards (typically more than $300 per\njob posting), but customers were so used to that price point that they\nwere skeptical of ClearFit’s value at $99/month. Ben says, “We don’t\ncompete with job boards, we partner with them, but at the time it\nseemed reasonable to have a lower price point to garner attention.”\nCustomers didn’t understand why they would pay a subscription fee\nfor something that they would most likely use sporadically. “When a\ncompany needs to hire, they want to do it fast and they’re willing to\ninvest at that moment in time,” says Ben. “Our customers are too small\nto have dedicated HR staff or recruiters that are constantly looking for\ntalent, and their hiring needs go up and down frequently.”\n\nBen and Jamie decided to abandon their low monthly subscription\nand switch to a model that their customers understood: a per-job fee.\nClearFit launched its new price point at $350 for a single job (for 30\ndays) and almost immediately saw three times the sales. The increase\nin volume and the higher price point improved revenue tenfold. “When\nwe increased the price,” Ben says, “it was an important signal to our\ncustomers. They understood the model and could more easily compare\nthe value against other solutions they use. Even though what we do is\ndifferent than a job board, we wanted our customers to feel comfortable\nwith purchasing from us, and we wanted to fit into how they budget\nfor recruiting.”\n\nIn ClearFit’s case, innovating on the business model didn’t make sense.\nBen says, “People don’t do subscriptions for haircuts, hamburgers, and\nhiring. You have to understand your customer, who they are, how and\nwhy they buy, and how they value your product or service.”\n\nClearFit’s switch to a per-job-posting model may go against the popular\ngrain of subscription-based SaaS businesses, but the company continues\nto see great success with 30% month-over-month revenue growth.\n\nCHAPter 9: MoDeL two: SoFtwAre AS A SerVICe (SAAS)\n\n99", "source_file": "Lean_Analytics.pdf", "extraction_method": "pdfminer", "ocr_used": false, "has_table": false, "chapter_num": "14", "chapter_title": "to understand how your current stage affects the metrics you", "section_num": null, "section_title": null, "l1_summary": "Two things confused ClearFit’s customers: the price point and the\nmonthly subscription.

If your product is ephemeral---like a transient job\nposting---it might be better to offer more transactional pricing. Pricing\nis a tricky beast. You need to test different price points qualitatively (by\ngetting feedback from customers) and quantitatively. Don’t assume a\nlow price is the answer; customers might not attribute enough value to\nyour offering. And remember that everything, including price, makes\nup the “product” you’re offering.\n\nWrinkles: Freemium, tiers, and Other Pricing Models\n\nIn a SaaS model, most of the complexity comes from two things: the\npromotional approach you choose, and pricing tiers.\n\nAs we’ve seen, some SaaS companies use a freemium model to convince\npeople to use the service, and then make money when those users exceed\nsome kind of cap. A second approach is a free trial, which converts to a paid\nsubscription if the customer doesn’t explicitly cancel after a certain time.\nA third approach is paid-only. There are others. Each has its benefits and\ndrawbacks---paid-only controls cost, is more predictable, and gives you\nan immediate idea of whether your offering is valuable; freemium allows\nyou to learn how people are using your service and builds goodwill. The\ndifference between these user groups can complicate analysis.\n\nThe second wrinkle comes from how you tier pricing. Since different\ncustomers have different levels of consumption, the price they pay may\nchange over time. This means you’re constantly trying to upsell users to\nbigger tiers, and predicting growth adds to the dimensions of a model,\nmaking it harder to predict and explain your business.\n\n100\n\nPArt two: FInDIng tHe rIgHt MetrIC For rIgHt now", "source_file": "Lean_Analytics.pdf", "extraction_method": "pdfminer", "ocr_used": false, "has_table": false, "chapter_num": "14", "chapter_title": "to understand how your current stage affects the metrics you", "section_num": null, "section_title": null, "l1_summary": "• The problem wasn’t the business model---it was the pricing and the Pricing\nis a tricky beast.

{"segment_id": "00133", "page_num": 133, "segment": "Average Revenue Per user\n\nMobile app developers are constantly finding ingenious ways to monetize\ntheir applications. These developers focus on the average revenue per user\n(ARPU) on a monthly or lifetime basis. Many game developers instrument\ntheir applications heavily themselves, since there isn’t a dominant, open\nway to collect data from applications easily.\n\nIf you’re making a game, you don’t just care about revenue. You’re walking\na fine line between the compelling content and addictive gameplay that\nmakes things fun and the in-game purchases that bring in money. Avoiding\nthe “money grab” that turns players off is hard: you need to keep users\ncoming back and inviting their friends while still extracting a pound of\nflesh each month (or at least a few dollars!). As a result, in addition to\nARPU, some metrics relate to playability (ensuring the game is neither too\nhard nor too easy, and that players don’t get stuck) and player engagement.\n\nARPU is simply the revenue you’ve made, divided by the number of active\nusers or players you have. If you inflate the number of active players to\nmake yourself look good, you’ll reduce the ARPU, so this metric forces you\nto draw a realistic line in the sand about what “engaged” means. Typically,\nARPU is calculated on a monthly period.\n\nFor mobile games, you can measure customer lifetime value (CLV) by\ncalculating the averages of the money spent by every player post-churn. But\nbecause it will (hopefully!) take months or years for a player to leave you,\nit’s easier to estimate the CLV in the way we did for a SaaS company.\n\nLet’s return to our example of a free mobile game that makes money\nfrom in-game purchases and ads. This month, it’s had just over 12,300\ndownloads, and 96% of those people launch the app and connect to the\ncompany’s servers. Of these, 30% become “engaged” players that use the\napplication on three separate days.\n\nEach engaged player generates, on average, $3.20 a month in revenue, from\na mix of in-game purchases and advertising. This means that the current\nmonth’s downloads will generate about $11,339 in revenue (though it may\ntake time for the company to receive that revenue because of the app store’s\npayment model).\n\nOf the total players, 15% churn every month, which means the average\nplayer lifetime is 6.67 months (1/0.15). This in turn means that the\ncompany’s monthly revenue is around $75,500. The player lifetime value\nis the ARPU multiplied by the player lifetime---in this case, $21.33. If\nthe company knows the cost of acquiring an engaged player, it can also\ncalculate the amount each player contributes to the bottom line, the return\non investment in advertising efforts, and how long it takes to recover the\n\nCHAPter 10: MoDeL tHree: Free MoBILe APP\n\n107", "source_file": "Lean_Analytics.pdf", "extraction_method": "pdfminer", "ocr_used": false, "has_table": false, "chapter_num": "14", "chapter_title": "to understand how your current stage affects the metrics you", "section_num": null, "section_title": null, "l1_summary": "Average Revenue Per user Each engaged player generates, on average, $3.20 a month in revenue, from\na mix of in-game purchases and advertising.

And\nthere are others (often referred to as “whales”) who will spend literally\nthousands of dollars to gain the upper hand in a game they love. Knowing\nthe difference between the two---and finding ways to make more users\npurchase things within the application---is the key to a successfully\nmonetized free mobile application.\n\nThe most basic metric here is the percentage of users who pay something.\nBeyond this basic metric, you want to do segmentation and cohort analysis.\nIf, for example, you know that a particular ad campaign brought in users\nwho were more likely to make in-game purchases, you should be running\nmore campaigns like that. You also need to be sophisticated in terms of\nwhat you market to users in-game: whales are more likely to make bigger\nin-app purchases, whereas users who haven’t bought anything yet should\nbe offered something inexpensive to start.\n\nMeasuring your ARPU gives you a good idea of how much paying users\nare spending.

The company is\nbuilding a formula for successful social games that’s completely driven by\nnumbers. The company has over 32 million active monthly users from 231\ncountries, and over 7 million daily users. In a 2012 Wired article, founder\nJens Begemann shared his company’s approach.*\n\nWooga iterates constantly and releases updates on a weekly basis. It\npicks a key metric to focus on for an update---retention, for example---\nand identifies a number of tactics to try to improve it. When the update\nis released, it measures the changes rigorously and adapts from there. All\ntold, Jens reviews 128 data points on a daily basis.

As we’ve seen, there are a wide variety of ways in which companies\nmonetize their mobile applications.

The key metric is average\nrevenue per user, but you may also track the average revenue per paying\nuser, since these “whales” are so distinct.\n\nMobile businesses are a lot like SaaS businesses: both try to engage users,\nextract money from them repeatedly, and reduce churn.

It relies on several\nfunnels: the one that brought the visitor to the site, the one that convinced\nthe visitor to click, and the one that ended in a purchase on a third-party\nsite.\n\nOur sports site is taking advantage of four distinct media monetization\nmodels. To do this, it’s had to set aside a considerable amount of its screen\nreal estate to accommodate a sponsor, a display banner, two click-through\nads, and an affiliate ad for a book. Of course, this undermines the site’s\nquality and leaves less room for valuable content that will keep visitors\n\n* Depending on the merchant, the affiliate may make money from the entire purchase, not just\nthe item listed on the affiliate site. If you buy a book on Amazon, and also buy a computer, the\naffiliate that referred you via the book makes a percentage of the computer sale---which gives\nAmazon a strong advantage when competing for affiliate ad real estate.\n\n116\n\nPArt two: FInDIng tHe rIgHt MetrIC For rIgHt now", "source_file": "Lean_Analytics.pdf", "extraction_method": "pdfminer", "ocr_used": false, "has_table": true, "tables": [{"table_id": "table_1", "rows": 11, "cols": 3, "data": [["Affiliate revenue", "Example", "Notes"], ["Affiliate ads per page", "1", "From your web layout"], ["Affiliate ads shown", "2,640,000", "Ads per page × page views"], ["Affiliate ad click percentage", "1.20%", "Depends on ad effective-\nness"], ["total affiliate ad clicks", "31,680", "Ads shown × affiliate ad\nclicks"], ["Affilate conversion rate", "4.30%", "Ability of the affiliate part-\nner to sell stuff"], ["total affiliate conversions", "1,362.24", "Ad clicks × conversion rate"], ["Average affiliate sale value", "$43.50", "Shopping cart size of the\naffiliate partner"], ["total affiliate sales", "$59,257.44", "revenue the affiliate made"], ["Affiliate percentage", "10%", "Percentage of affiliate rev-\nenue you get"], ["total affiliate contribution", "$5,925.74", "Affiliate sales × affiliate per-\ncentage"]], "markdown": "| Affiliate revenue | Example | Notes |\n|---|---|---|\n| Affiliate ads per page | 1 | From your web layout |\n| Affiliate ads shown | 2,640,000 | Ads per page × page views |\n| Affiliate ad click percentage | 1.20% | Depends on ad effective-\nness |\n| total affiliate ad clicks | 31,680 | Ads shown × affiliate ad\nclicks |\n| Affilate conversion rate | 4.30% | Ability of the affiliate part-\nner to sell stuff |\n| total affiliate conversions | 1,362.24 | Ad clicks × conversion rate |\n| Average affiliate sale value | $43.50 | Shopping cart size of the\naffiliate partner |\n| total affiliate sales | $59,257.44 | revenue the affiliate made |\n| Affiliate percentage | 10% | Percentage of affiliate rev-\nenue you get |\n| total affiliate contribution | $5,925.74 | Affiliate sales × affiliate per-\ncentage |"}], "table_count": 1, "chapter_num": "14", "chapter_title": "to understand how your current stage affects the metrics you", "section_num": null, "section_title": null, "l1_summary": "Affiliate ad click percentage 4.30% Ability of the affiliate parttotal affiliate conversions $5,925.74 Affiliate sales × affiliate percentage", "l2_summary": "Affiliate ad click percentage total affiliate ad clicks 4.30% Ability of the affiliate parttotal affiliate conversions total affiliate sales 10% Percentage of affiliate revenue you get $5,925.74 Affiliate sales × affiliate percentage", "prev_page": {"page_num": 141, "segment_id": "00141"}, "next_page": {"page_num": 143, "segment_id": "00143"}, "extended_fields": {"has_code": false, "has_formulas": true, "has_diagram": false, "has_list": false, "has_citations": false, "key_terms": ["affiliate", "site", "book", "percentage", "page", "clicks", "revenue", "make", "money", "when"], "content_type": "theory", "domain": "programming", "complexity": "intermediate", "companies": ["Amazon"], "people": [], "products": ["sports books", "book of the week", "computer"], "technologies": [], "frameworks": [], "methodologies": [], "programming_languages": [], "has_best_practices": false, "has_antipatterns": false, "has_instructions": false, "has_metrics": true, "metrics": ["Affiliate revenue", "Affiliate ads per page", "Affiliate ads shown", "Affiliate ad click percentage", "Example", "Notes"], "has_case_study": false, "case_study_company": null, "tools_mentioned": [], "topics": ["affiliate marketing", "revenue calculation", "sports book sales"], "key_concepts": ["affiliate model", "affiliate revenue calculation", "complexity of affiliate model"], "problem_statement": null, "solution_approach": null, "extraction_method": "lm"}}

Each month, it adds a certain number of unique firsttime visitors to the site, but it also loses some visitors. You can calculate\nthe churn by subtracting the number of unique first-time visitors from the\nchange over the previous month---the new visitors are “making up” the last\nmonth’s loss.\n\nNote that sometimes an effective campaign can mask a churn problem. In\nthis example, even though the site grew by 2,000 unique visitors in April,\nit managed to lose 1,000 visitors as well.\n\nIf you have the ability to test different layouts---one with fewer ads, for\nexample---across visitor segments, you can determine the level of “churn\ntax” you’re paying for having commercial content on the page. Then you\ncan balance this against the revenue you’re earning from advertising.\n\nInventory\n\nTracking unique visitors is a good start, but you need to measure ad\ninventory as well.

Here are four examples of\nthe kinds of complexity you need to watch out for.\n\nHidden affiliate models\n\nPinterest, an online pinboard of images, used to rewrite URLs for pictures of products its users had uploaded using a tool called Skimlinks.\nBut as the site grew, its affiliate revenue quickly outstripped that of\nother big networks,* and it was called out for the practice.†\n\nPinterest was able to monetize traffic quickly with this strategy, and\ncared not only about how many people contributed content (a usergenerated content, or UGC, metric), but also about the likelihood that\nsomeone would click on a picture and in turn make a purchase. Affiliate rewriting is a good way to monetize user-generated content without\nads---effectively turning everything that’s posted into an ad---but complicates business modeling, and can backfire.\n\nBackground noise\n\nIn one test, blank ads bearing no information had a click-through rate\nof roughly 0.08%---comparable to that of some paid campaigns.‡ The\nads invited those who’d clicked to explain why they did so; respondents\nwere evenly divided between simple curiosity and accidental clicking.\nIf your ads are getting revenues that are hardly better than the background noise a blank ad would get, you need to find out why.\n\nAd blockers\n\nTechnical users sometimes install ad-blocking software in their browsers that blocks ads from known ad-serving companies. This reduces\nyour inventory, and can mess with your analytics.

YouTube monetizes user content, relying on popular videos with\nvirality to drive traffic and ad inventory. If your site is an unwalled garden---\nthat is, users can share freely with the rest of the world---then tracking how\ncontent is shared is critical. It’s less important for walled-garden sites like\nFacebook, whose goal is to keep users within the application.\n\nWhile tweeting and liking content is useful, remember that a lot of sharing\nhappens through other systems---RSS feeds and email, in particular. In fact\nTynt, which makes tools for publishers to tag sharing when a link is copied\nand pasted, estimates that as much as 80% of sharing happens through\nemail.†\n\nYou want to track how content is shared for several reasons:\n\n• You need to know if you’re achieving a level of virality that will sustain\n\nyour business.\n\n• You want to understand how content is shared and with whom. If every\nreader sends a URL to someone else, and that person then returns, you\nneed to know that the visit was the result of a share, because the value\nof the content wasn’t just the ad inventory it presented, but also the\nadditional visit it generated.\n\n• It will help you understand whether you should consider a paywallstyle monetization strategy.\n\nnotification Effectiveness\n\nWe used to design exclusively for the Web. In recent years, designers rallied\naround portable devices with cries of “design for mobile” or “mobile\nfirst.” But there’s good reason to think that the future of applications isn’t\nmobility---it’s notification.\n\nToday’s mobile device is a prosthetic brain. We rely on it to remind us of\nmeetings, tell us when others are thinking of us, and find our way home.\nSmart agent technologies like Siri and Google Now will only reinforce this.\n\n* See “Case Study: Circle of Moms explores Its way to Success” in Chapter 2.\n\n† http:///publications/article/181944/quick-whats-the-largest-digital-socialmedia-pla.html\n\n132\n\nPArt two: FInDIng tHe rIgHt MetrIC For rIgHt now", "source_file": "Lean_Analytics.pdf", "extraction_method": "pdfminer", "ocr_used": false, "has_table": false, "chapter_num": "11", "chapter_title": "MoDeL FoUr: MeDIA SIte", "section_num": null, "section_title": null, "l1_summary": "Content Sharing and Virality You want to track how content is shared for several reasons: • You want to understand how content is shared and with whom.", "l2_summary": "did when he compared engagement and value across user segments on\nCircle of Friends and launched Circle of Moms as a result).* Content Sharing and Virality YouTube monetizes user content, relying on popular videos with\nvirality to drive traffic and ad inventory.

{"segment_id": "00165", "page_num": 165, "segment": "Case st udy | What DuProprio Watches\n\nDuProprio/Comfree is the largest for-sale-by-owner marketplace, and\nsecond-most-visited real estate network in Canada. Founded in 1997\nby co-president Nicolas Bouchard, it lists 17,000 properties and has\nroughly 5 million visits a month. The company charges a one-time\nfee of around $900 for a listing, assistance with pricing, signage, and\nHDR photography. Additional tools, from legal advice to real estate\ncoaching, are available for an extra fee. The company also has affiliate\nlisting relationships with a prominent newspaper.\n\nNicolas was Lean before Lean came along. The son of a realtor and an\nentrepreneur from a young age---already running a hardwood flooring\nbusiness while in high school---he helped his father build a website in\nthe early days of the Web. Then he had an epiphany. “I started to notice\nthe black-and-orange ‘for sale by owner’ signs in hardware stores.\nSo I made the connection, and said, ‘let’s do a real estate website for\nowners.’ I launched it in my parents’ basement.”\n\nThe first version of the website was static, built on Microsoft Frontpage.\nThere was no staff. Nicolas acquired new sellers by scouring the\nclassified ads and driving around looking for “for sale by owner” signs,\nconvincing sellers to list with his site. “Back then, the only KPI was the\nnumber of signs we had on people’s lawns---because that’s how buyers\nfound my website,” he recalls. “That, and of course, the number of\nproperties listed on the website.”\n\nGradually, Nicolas found other sources of potential sellers, looking at\nsites like Craigslist and Kijiji. “It was the beginning of the Internet,” he\nsays. “I was still playing with how to pitch the service and how to use\nthe Web to my advantage, and that of my clients.”\n\nIn early 2000, once the company had found some traction, it switched\nfrom a static site to a dynamic one, and manually transferred all the\nseller listings to the new site. Until that point, it had only rudimentary\nanalytics---little more than a page hit counter. It added Webtrends for\nanalytics.

But the data still wasn’t precise: the\ncompany was still focusing on visits, not visitors.\n\nOne reason for this was that the two-sided marketplace was more\ncomplicated than it might seem. Often, someone selling a house was\nalso looking for a new one---which made it hard to segment traffic\ncleanly between the two groups---so Nicolas settled for a simple rule of\nthumb. “At some point we had a metric that 1,000 visits on the website\nequals 1 subscription.” Despite the coarseness of this baseline, it was\nenough to draw a line in the sand. “This was a rudimentary conversion\nrate,” he says. “The objective was to generate more conversions per\nvisit.”\n\nAs the company became more sophisticated about analysis, it improved\nits analytics further. “We started to look at the conversion rate of\nvisitors coming to the subscription page, where we display the various\npackages we offer,” he says. “We started to be a bit more disciplined,\nbut this was long before we did any real A/B testing.” The company\nwas making modifications to its website to see if they improved\nconversions or the visits-to-listings ratio, but this was still a month-bymonth process.\n\nWhile the company has detailed analytics from Google today, Nicolas\ndoesn’t concern himself with details. “There are always more visitors\nlooking to buy a property,” he points out. He also doesn’t focus as\nmuch on buyer-side account creation. “In Québec alone, we have 3\nmillions visits a month, and 1.2 million unique visitors a month, but\nonly a small fraction of those---5% or less---create an account.”\n\nNicolas does care a lot about competitors, however. “We want to be as\ngood as possible, and better than real estate agents. We have data from\nthe Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation and the Canadian\nReal Estate Board, so we know exactly how many properties were\nlisted and sold. We benchmark ourselves against these numbers all the\ntime, region by region.”\n\nToday, the company has three big goals. It wants to convince sellers to\nlist their property on the site, it wants to convince buyers to register for\nnotifications when a property becomes available, and it wants to sell\nthe properties.\n\n140\n\nPArt two: FInDIng tHe rIgHt MetrIC For rIgHt now", "source_file": "Lean_Analytics.pdf", "extraction_method": "pdfminer", "ocr_used": false, "has_table": false, "chapter_num": "11", "chapter_title": "MoDeL FoUr: MeDIA SIte", "section_num": null, "section_title": null, "l1_summary": "But the data still wasn’t precise: the\ncompany was still focusing on visits, not visitors.

Then find ways\nof making money from that activity. The metrics you track will depend\non transaction size, frequency, and other unique characteristics of the\nbusiness. But the fundamentals are the same: revenue from transactions.\n\nImagine you’re launching a two-sided marketplace for secondhand game\nconsoles. Those with a console to sell can list it, and those looking for a\nconsole to buy can browse by a variety of criteria. The transactions are\nhandled through PayPal, and you retain a portion of the proceeds above a\nminimum amount.\n\nBecause you’re not a vendor of consoles yourself, you need to find a way to\nproduce either an inventory of consoles, or a large group of customers. You\nneed to pick which side of the market you’re going to “seed.”\n\nIf you want to seed the seller side, you might crawl Craigslist and approach\nconsole owners to see if they have inventory, encouraging them to list items.\nIf you want to seed the buyer side, you might set up a forum for nostalgic\ngame players, bringing them together and inviting them from social sites.\n\nYou could create an artificial inventory by selling consoles to start with, and\nthen gradually adding inventory from others. Car-service provider Uber\novercame the chicken-and-egg problem in new markets by simply buying up\navailable towncars: when the company launched in Seattle, it paid drivers\n$30 an hour to drive passengers around, and switched to a commission\nmodel only once it had sufficient demand to make it worthwhile for the\ndrivers. The company created supply.\n\nOn the other hand, if you want to seed the buyer side, you probably need\nto pick something for which you can command an initial inventory, then\npurchase some; or you might take orders with a promise of fulfilling them\nlater, knowing you have access to that inventory. Amazon, for example,\nstarted selling books, which allowed it to streamline its order, search, and\nlogistics processes. Then it could offer a broader range of its own goods.\nEventually, with access to many buyers and their search patterns, Amazon\nbecame a marketplace for goods from many other suppliers. Salesforce.com\ncreated a CRM product, and then created an app exchange ecosystem where\nthird-party developers could sell software to existing customers. With respect\nto their marketplace offerings, both companies first created demand.\n\nThe health of their chicken-and-egg-defeating strategy was a critical metric:\n\n142\n\nPArt two: FInDIng tHe rIgHt MetrIC For rIgHt now", "source_file": "Lean_Analytics.pdf", "extraction_method": "pdfminer", "ocr_used": false, "has_table": false, "chapter_num": "11", "chapter_title": "MoDeL FoUr: MeDIA SIte", "section_num": null, "section_title": null, "l1_summary": "You\nneed to pick which side of the market you’re going to “seed.” You could create an artificial inventory by selling consoles to start with, and\nthen gradually adding inventory from others.

If\nyou start to saturate your marketplace (i.e., if most of the sellers in your\nmarket have already become members), then your growth will come from\nincreasing their listings and the effectiveness of those listings.\n\nBuyer Searches\n\nIn many two-sided markets, searches are the primary way in which buyers\nfind sellers.

But as Internet\ngiants like Google, Amazon, and Facebook have shown, parts of the Web\nare dystopian. Two-sided marketplaces are subject to strong network\neffects---the more inventory they have to offer, the more useful they become.\nA marketplace with no inventory, on the other hand, is useless.\n\nSuccessful two-sided marketplaces find a way to artificially populate either\nthe buyer or the seller side early on. As a particular niche matures, this\nnetwork effect means there will be a few dominant players---as is the case\nwith Airbnb, VRBO, and a few others in the rental property space.\n\nFraud and trust are the other big issues for such marketplaces. You don’t\nwant to assume responsibility for the delivery of goods or services within\nyour marketplace, but you need to ensure that there are reliable reputation\nsystems. Buyer and seller ratings are one approach to this, but there are\nother ways. Some dating sites offer guarantees (for example, that they will\nprosecute if a person turns out to be married).\n\nOne more major issue is keeping the transaction within the network. In\nthe case of a sailboat or house marketplace, the transaction may be tens\nor even hundreds of thousands of dollars. That’s not really suitable for a\nPayPal transaction, and it’s hard to stop “leakage”---buyers and sellers find\none another through your marketplace, and then conclude their business\nwithout you getting a transaction fee.\n\nThere are a number of ways to overcome this---all of which you should test\nto see if they work for your product and market. For example, you might:\n\n• Refer users to an outside agent to conclude the transaction (e.g., a\n\nrealtor) and monetize the referral.\n\n• Charge a fee (instead of a percentage) proportional to the value of the\n\nitem the seller is listing.\n\n• Monetize something else about the market, such as in-site advertising,\n\nshipping services, or favorable placement.\n\n• Make it impossible for the two parties to connect or find each other’s\nidentity until after the transaction is confirmed (as discount travel site\nHotwire does).\n\n• Offer value-added services (such as purchase insurance or escrow) that\n\nencourage participants to keep you in the deal.\n\nCHAPter 13: MoDeL SIx: two-SIDeD MArKetPLACeS\n\n151", "source_file": "Lean_Analytics.pdf", "extraction_method": "pdfminer", "ocr_used": false, "has_table": false, "chapter_num": "11", "chapter_title": "MoDeL FoUr: MeDIA SIte", "section_num": null, "section_title": null, "l1_summary": "Wrinkles: Chicken and Egg, Fraud, Keeping the\ntransaction, and Auctions Buyer and seller ratings are one approach to this, but there are\nother ways.

That means getting out of the building,\ninterviewing people, and running surveys.\n\n153", "source_file": "Lean_Analytics.pdf", "extraction_method": "pdfminer", "ocr_used": false, "has_table": false, "chapter_num": "11", "chapter_title": "MoDeL FoUr: MeDIA SIte", "section_num": null, "section_title": null, "l1_summary": "What Stage Are you At?

{"segment_id": "00180", "page_num": 180, "segment": "2. Second, you need stickiness, which comes from a good product. You\nneed to find out if you can build a solution to the problem you’ve\ndiscovered. There’s no point in promoting something awful if your\nvisitors will bounce right off it in disgust. Companies like Color that\nattempted to scale prematurely, without having proven stickiness,\nhaven’t fared well.\n\n3. Third, you need virality. Once you’ve got a product or service that’s\nsticky, it’s time to use word of mouth. That way, you’ll test out your\nacquisition and onboarding processes on new visitors who are motivated\nto try you, because you have an implied endorsement from an existing\nuser. Virality is also a force multiplier for paid promotion, so you want\nto get it right before you start spending money on customer acquisition\nthrough inorganic methods like advertising.\n\n4. Fourth, you need revenue. You’ll want to monetize things at this\npoint. That doesn’t mean you haven’t already been charging---for\nmany businesses, even the first customer has to pay. It just means that\nearlier on, you’re less focused on revenue than on growth. You’re giving\naway free trials, free drinks, or free copies. Now you’re focused on\nmaximizing and optimizing revenue.\n\n5. Fifth, you need scale. With revenues coming in, it’s time to move from\ngrowing your business to growing your market. You need to acquire\nmore customers from new verticals and geographies. You can invest\nin channels and distribution to help grow your user base, since direct\ninteraction with individual customers is less critical---you’re past\nproduct/market fit and you’re analyzing things quantitatively.\n\nSo, as we shared in Chapter 5, we suggest these five Lean Analytics stages,\nand we believe you should go through them in the order shown in Figure\n14-1, unless you have a really good reason to do otherwise.\n\nWhile many of the examples we’ve looked at are technology companies---\nand many of those are B2C (business to consumer) companies---these five\nstages apply equally well to a restaurant as they do to an enterprise software\ncompany.\n\n154\n\nPArt two: FInDIng tHe rIgHt MetrIC For rIgHt now", "source_file": "Lean_Analytics.pdf", "extraction_method": "pdfminer", "ocr_used": false, "has_table": false, "chapter_num": "11", "chapter_title": "MoDeL FoUr: MeDIA SIte", "section_num": null, "section_title": null, "l1_summary": "Third, you need virality.

Stickiness: She meets with an initial group of prospects and signs\ncontracts that look more like consulting agreements, which she uses\nto build an initial product. She’s careful not to commit to exclusivity,\nand tries to steer customers toward standardized solutions, charging\nheavily for custom features. Her engineers handle customer support\ndirectly, rather than having an “insulating layer” of support staff in\nthis early stage, so they have to confront the warts and wrinkles of\nwhat they’ve created.\n\n3. Virality: Product in hand, she asks for references from satisfied customers\nand uses those as testimonials. She starts direct sales and grows the\ncustomer base. She launches a user group and starts to automate\nsupport. She releases an API, encouraging third-party development and\nscaling potential market size without direct development.\n\n4. Revenue: She focuses on growing the pipeline, sales margins, and\nrevenues while controlling costs. Tasks are automated, outsourced,\nor offshored. Feature enhancements are scored based on anticipated\npayoff and development cost. Recurring license and support revenue\nbecomes an increasingly large component of overall revenues.\n\n5.

While some people say\n“ideas are easy,” that’s not entirely true. Coming up with an idea is hard.\nComing up with a good idea is harder. Coming up with an idea that you\ngo out and validate to the point where it makes sense to build something is\nreally, really hard.\n\nProblem (or idea) discovery often starts with listening. After all, people love\nto complain about their problems. But take their complaining with a grain\nof salt. You need to listen actively, almost aggressively, for the nugget of\ntruth or the underlying pattern. Big, lucrative startups are often the result\nof wildly audacious solutions to problems people didn’t realize they had.\n\nDiscovery is the muse that launches startups.\n\nIn some cases, you won’t need to discover a problem. It will be the reason you\nfounded a startup in the first place. This is particularly true for enterprisefocused initiatives or startup efforts that happen within a willing host\ncompany. As an intrapreneur, you may have noticed a pattern in customer\nsupport issues that suggests the need for a new product. If you’re selling\nto enterprises, maybe you were an end user who realized something was\nmissing, or a former employee of a vendor who saw an opportunity.\n\nYour idea is simply a starting point.

You\nmay also get some insight that you hadn’t thought of: information about\ncompetitors, target markets, different takes on the idea, and so on.\n\nThis quick “sniff test” is an excellent investment for the first few days after\nyou get an idea, before committing any formal work to it.

Let’s break down what that means:\n\nThe problem is painful enough\n\nPeople are full of inertia. You want them to act, and you want them to\ndo so in a way that helps your business. This requires enough discomfort with their situation that they actually do what you want---signing\nup, paying your price, etc.\n\nEnough people care\n\nSolving a problem for one person is called consulting. You need an\naddressable market. Marketers want audiences that are homogeneous\nwithin (that is, members of the segment have things in common to\nwhich you can appeal) and heterogeneous between (that is, you can\nsegment and target each market segment in a focused manner with a\ntailored message).\n\nThey’re already trying to solve it\n\nIf the problem is real and known, people are dealing with it somehow.\nMaybe they’re doing something manually, because they don’t have a\nbetter way. The current solution, whatever it is, will be your biggest\ncompetitor at first, because it’s the path of least resistance for people.\n\nNote that in some cases, your market won’t know it has a problem. Before\nthe Walkman, the minivan, or the tablet computer, people didn’t know\nthey had a need---indeed, Apple’s ill-fated Newton a decade before the iPad\nshowed that the need didn’t exist. In this case, rather than just testing for\na problem people know they have, you’re also interested in what it takes\nto make them aware of the problem. If you’re going to have to “plow the\nsnow” in your market, you want to know how much effort it will be so you\ncan factor that into your business models.\n\nYou need to validate each of these (and a few more things too) before\nmoving to the next stage.

{"segment_id": "00189", "page_num": 189, "segment": "Pattern | Running Lean and How to Conduct a\n\ngood Interview\n\nAsh Maurya is one of the leaders in the Lean Startup movement. He’s\nexperimented and documented Lean Startup practices for several years\nwith his own startups, and he wrote a great book called Running Lean\n(O’Reilly). It’s a good complement to this book.\n\nAsh describes a prescriptive, systematic approach for interviewing\npeople during the early stages of the Lean Startup process.\n\nFor starters, you need to conduct problem interviews. You decouple\nthe solution (which we know you’re excited about!) from the problem,\nand focus on the problem alone. The goal is to find a problem worth\nsolving. And remember, customers are tired of solutions---they get\npitched continually on magical doohickeys that will make their lives\neasier. But most of the time, the people pitching don’t understand the\ncustomers’ real problems.\n\nHere are some tips from Ash and Running Lean for conducting good\ninterviews:\n\n• Aim for face-to-face interviews. You not only want to hear what\npeople are saying, you also want to see how they’re saying it. People\nare generally much less distracted when meeting face-to-face, so\nyou’ll get a higher quality of response.\n\n• Pick a neutral location. If you go to a subject’s office, it’s going to\nfeel more like a sales pitch. Find a coffee shop or something casual.\n\n• Avoid recording interviews. Ash notes that in his experience,\nsubjects get more self-conscious if the interview is being recorded,\nand the quality of interviews subsequently drops.\n\n• Make sure you have a script. While you may adjust the script a bit\nover time, you’re not tweaking it constantly in order to “get the\nanswers you want” or rig anything in your favor. You have to stay\nhonest throughout the process.\n\nThe script is probably the hardest thing to do well. Early on, you may\nnot even be sure what questions to ask. In fact, that’s why surveys\ndon’t work at an early stage---you just don’t know what to ask in order\nto collect meaningful information. But a script will give you enough\nconsistency from interview to interview that you can compare notes.\n\nCHAPter 15 : StAge one: eMPAtHY\n\n163", "source_file": "Lean_Analytics.pdf", "extraction_method": "pdfminer", "ocr_used": false, "has_table": false, "chapter_num": "11", "chapter_title": "MoDeL FoUr: MeDIA SIte", "section_num": null, "section_title": null, "l1_summary": "Pattern | Running Lean and How to Conduct a Here are some tips from Ash and Running Lean for conducting good\ninterviews: • Aim for face-to-face interviews.", "l2_summary": "Pattern | Running Lean and How to Conduct a Ash Maurya is one of the leaders in the Lean Startup movement.

You want to give\nsubjects the opportunity to tell you whatever they want to, and you\nwant them to do so in a comfortable free-form manner.\n\nIn Running Lean, Ash provides a very good breakdown of interview\nscripts. We’ve summarized the problem interview script as follows:\n\n• Briefly set the stage for how the interview works. This is the point\nwhere you tell the interviewee what you’re going to tell (or ask) her.\nHighlight the goals of the interview to put the interviewee in the\nright frame of mind.\n\n• Test the customer segment by collecting demographics. Ask\nthe subject some basic questions to learn more about her and\nunderstand what market segment she represents. These questions\ndepend a great deal on the types of people you speak to. Ultimately,\nyou want to learn about their business or their lifestyle (in the\ncontext of the problems you’re proposing to solve), and learn more\nabout their role.\n\n• Set the problem context by telling a story. Connect with the subject\nby walking her through how you identified the problems you’re\nhoping to solve, and why you think these problems matter. If\nyou’re scratching your own itch, this will be a lot easier. If you\ndon’t understand the problems clearly, or you don’t have good\nhypotheses for the problems you’re looking to solve, it’s going to\nshow at this point.\n\n• Test the problem by getting the subject to rank the problems.\nRestate the problems you’ve described and ask the subject to rank\nthem in order of importance. Don’t dig too deeply, but make sure\nto ask her if there are other related problems that you didn’t touch\non.\n\n• Test the solution. Explore the subject’s worldview. Hand things\nover to the customer and listen. Go through each problem---in the\norder the subject ranked them---and ask the subject how she solves\nit today. There’s no more script. Just let the subject talk. This is\nthe point in the interview when you can really do a qualitative\nassessment of whether or not you’ve found problems worth solving.\nIt may go well, with subjects begging you to solve the problem, or\nyou might get a resounding “meh,” in which case there’s a clear\ndisconnect between your business and the real world.\n\n164\n\nPArt two: FInDIng tHe rIgHt MetrIC For rIgHt now", "source_file": "Lean_Analytics.pdf", "extraction_method": "pdfminer", "ocr_used": false, "has_table": false, "chapter_num": "11", "chapter_title": "MoDeL FoUr: MeDIA SIte", "section_num": null, "section_title": null, "l1_summary": "We’ve summarized the problem interview script as follows: • Test the problem by getting the subject to rank the problems.

We go along with the herd and side with\nthe majority. This has disastrous effects on the results you get from\nrespondents: you don’t want to make something nobody wants, but\neverybody lies about wanting it. What’s a founder to do?\n\nYou can’t change people’s fundamental nature. Response bias is a wellunderstood type of cognitive bias, exploited by political campaigners\nto get the answer they want by leading the witness (this is known as\npush polling).\n\nYou can, however, do four things: don’t tip your hand, make the\nquestion real, keep digging, and look for other clues.\n\nDon’t tip your Hand\n\nWe’re surprisingly good at figuring out what someone else wants\nfrom us. The people you interview will do everything they can, at a\nsubconscious level, to guess what you want them to say. They’ll pick up\non a variety of cues.\n\n• Biased wording, such as “do you agree that...” is one such cue. This\nleads to an effect called acquiescence bias, where a respondent will\ntry to agree with the positive statement. You can get around this\nby asking people the opposite of what you’re hoping they’ll say---if\nthey are willing to disagree with you in order to express their need\nfor a particular solution, that’s a stronger signal that you’ve found\na problem worth solving.\n\n• This is one reason why, early in the customer development process,\nopen-ended questions are useful: they color the answers less and\ngive the respondent a chance to ramble.\n\n• Preconceptions are another strong influencer. If the subject knows\nthings about you, he’ll likely go along with them. For example, he’ll\nanswer more positively to questions on the need for environmental\nprotection if he knows you’re a vegetarian. The fewer things he\nknows about you, the less he’ll be able to skew things. Anonymity\ncan be a useful asset here; this is a big reason to keep your mouth\nshut and let him talk, and to work from a standardized script.\n\n• Other social cues come from appearance.

The platform is\nprimarily for JavaScript and Node.js applications, but it’s expanding\nto support other languages as well. The company has raised Series A\nfinancing from Accel and Atlassian.\n\nAlthough the Cloud9 IDE team is well past the initial problem interview\nstage, they regularly speak with customers and engage in systematic\ncustomer development. Product Manager Ivar Pruijn says, “We’re\nclose to product/market fit, and it helps us a great deal to speak with\ncustomers, understanding if we’re meeting their needs and how they’re\nusing our product.”\n\nIvar took the scoring framework outlined previously and modified\nsome of the questions for the types of interviews he was doing. “Since\nwe’re now speaking with customers using our product, we asked\nslightly different questions, but we scored them just the same,” he says.\nThe first two questions that Ivar asked himself after conducting an\ninterview were:\n\n1. Did the interviewee mention problems in his/her workflow that our\n\nproduct solves or will solve soon?\n\n2. Is the interviewee actively trying to solve the problems our product\n\nsolves/will solve soon, or has he/she done so in the past?\n\n“With these questions, we’re trying to determine how well we’re solving\nproblems for actual customers. If many of the scores would have been\nlow, we would have known something was wrong,” he says.\n\nHappily, most of the interview scores were good, but Ivar was able\nto dig deeper and learn more. “I was able to identify the customer\ntypes to focus on for product improvements. I noticed that two specific\ncustomer segments scored the highest on the interviews, especially the\nfirst two scoring criteria about meeting their needs and solving their\nproblems.”\n\nAfter scoring the initial interviews, Ivar then verified the results and the\nscoring in two ways. First, he interviewed some of the company’s top\nactive users, gaining an in-depth knowledge of how they work. Second,\nhe analyzed the data warehouse, which has information on how the\nproduct is being used.

They attack\nmarket leaders with features, functionality, and strategies that aren’t\nmeaningful enough to customers. Their MVP has too much “minimum”\nto provoke a change. They assume that what they’re doing---whether it’s\na slicker UI, simpler system, social functionality, or something else---is an\nobvious win. Then “good enough” bites them in the ass.\n\nThe bar for startups to succeed at any real scale is much higher than that\nof the market leaders. The market leaders are already there, and even if\nthey’re losing ground, it’s generally at a slow pace. Startups need to scale\nas quickly as possible.

We mentioned collecting demographics earlier and looking for\nways to bucket customers into different groups, but you can take this a step\nfurther and gain a lot more insight. You can get inside their heads.\n\nCustomers are people. They lead lives. They have kids, they eat too much,\nthey don’t sleep well, they phone in sick, they get bored, they watch too\nmuch reality TV. If you’re building for some kind of idealized, economically\nrational buyer, you’ll fail. But if you know your customers, warts and all,\nand you build things that naturally fit into their lives, they’ll love you.\n\nTo do this, you need to infiltrate your customer’s daily life. Don’t think of\n“infiltrate” as a bad word. In order for you to succeed, customers need to\nuse your application; if you want them to do so, you need to slot yourself\ninto their lives in an effortless, seamless way. Understanding customers’\ndaily lives means you can map out everything they do, and when they do\nit. With the right approach, you’ll start to understand why as well. You’ll\nidentify influences (bosses, friends, family members, employees, etc.),\nlimitations, constraints, and opportunities.\n\nOne tactic for mapping this out is a “day in the life” storyboard. A\nstoryboard is visual---it’s going to involve lots of multicolored sticky notes\nplastered on the wall---and it allows you to navigate through a customer’s\nlife and figure out where your solution will have the most impact. Figure\n15-1 shows an example of a storyboard.\n\nHaving this map in place makes it much easier to come up with good\nhypotheses around how, when, and by whom your solution will be used.\nYou can experiment with different tactics for interrupting users and\ninfiltrating their lives. The right level of positive access will allow to use\nyour product successfully..\n\nMapping a day in the life of your customer will also reveal obvious holes\nin your understanding of your customer, and those are areas of risk you\nmay want to tackle quickly. With a clearer understanding of when and how\nyour solution will be used, you have a better chance of defining a minimum\nviable product feature set that hits the mark.\n\nThe “day in the life” exercise is a way of describing a very detailed, human\nuse case for your solution that goes beyond simply defining target markets\nand customer segments. After all, you’ll be selling to people.

But before you do any of these,\nknow why you’re asking the questions in the first place. Lean is all\nabout identifying and quantifying the risk. What kind of uncertainty\nare you trying to quantify by doing a survey?\n\n• If you’re asking what existing brands come to mind in a particular\nindustry, will you use this information to market alongside them?\nAddress competitive threats? Choose partners?\n\n• If you’re asking how customers try to find a product or service, will\n\nthis inform your marketing campaigns and choice of media?\n\n• If you’re asking how much money people spend on a problem you’re\nplanning to address, how will this shape your pricing strategy?\n\n• If you’re testing which tagline or unique value proposition resonates\nbest with customers, will you choose the winning one, or just take\nthat as advice?\n\nDon’t just ask questions. Know how the answers to the questions will\nchange your behavior. In other words, draw a line in the sand before\nyou run the survey. Your earlier problem interviews showed you an\nopportunity; now, you’re checking to see whether that opportunity exists\nin the market as a whole. For each quantifiable question, decide what\nwould be a “good” score. Write it down somewhere so you’ll remember.\n\nSurvey Design\n\nYour survey should include three kinds of questions:\n\n• Demographics and psychographics you can use to segment the\n\nresponses, such as age, gender, or Internet usage.\n\n• Quantifiable questions that you can analyze statistically, such as\nratings, agreement or disagreement with a statement, or selecting\nsomething from a list.\n\n• Open-ended questions that allow respondents to add qualitative\n\ndata.\n\nAlways ask the segmentation questions up front and the open-ended\nones at the end. That way you know if your sample was representative\nof the market you’re targeting, and if people don’t finish the last\nquestions, you still have enough quantitative responses to generate\nresults in which you can be confident.\n\n190\n\nPArt two: FInDIng tHe rIgHt MetrIC For rIgHt now", "source_file": "Lean_Analytics.pdf", "extraction_method": "pdfminer", "ocr_used": false, "has_table": false, "chapter_num": "11", "chapter_title": "MoDeL FoUr: MeDIA SIte", "section_num": null, "section_title": null, "l1_summary": "Don’t just ask questions.

This is\nno exaggeration: everyone gets surveys wrong.\n\nSend the Survey Out\n\nYou want to reach people you don’t know.

We’re\n\ntrying to fix that, and want your input.”)\n\n• Mention the solution or your unique value proposition, without\na sales pitch. (“Our accounting software automatically finds tax\nbreaks. Help us plan the product roadmap.”) Be careful not to\nlead the witness; don’t use this if you’re still trying to settle on\npositioning.\n\nRemember, too, that the first question you’re asking is “Was my message\ncompelling enough to convince them to take the survey?” You’re trying\nout a number of different value propositions. In some cases, you don’t\neven care about a survey---we know one entrepreneur who tried out\nvarious taglines, all of which pointed to a spam site. All he needed to\nknow was which one got the most clicks, and he didn’t want to tell\nanyone who he was yet.\n\nYou can also use mailing lists. Some user groups or newsletters may\nbe willing to feature you on their page or in a mail-out if what you’re\ndoing is relevant to their audience.\n\nCollect the Information\n\nWhen you run the survey, measure your cost per completed response.\nDo a small test of a few dozen responses first.

The company felt this was a huge risk; if\nquestions went unanswered, users would have a terrible experience and\nstop using Localmind. But how could it prove (or disprove) that people\nwould answer questions from strangers without building the app?\n\nThe team looked to Twitter and ran an experiment. Tracking geolocated\ntweets (primarily in Times Square, because there were lots of them there\nover several days), they sent @ messages to people who had just tweeted.\nThe messages would be questions about the area: how busy is it, is the\nsubway running on time, is something open, etc. These were the types\nof questions they believed people would ask through Localmind.\n\nThe response rate to their tweeted questions was very high. This gave\nthe team the confidence to assume that people would answer questions\nabout where they were, even if they didn’t know who was asking.

So the founders devised a test: why not act\nas if the recipient already had an account, send her a survey question\nshe can respond to with a single click or tap, and see what the response\nrate is like? The act of responding could be treated as tacit acceptance\nof enrollment; later, if the recipient wanted to log into her account, she\ncould do so through a password recovery.\n\nThe qidiq team quickly changed their application, as illustrated in\nFigure 16-1, and sent out more surveys to personal groups they’d\ncreated. These initial surveys were sent via email alone. The results\nwere striking: response rates went from 10--25% with the enroll-first\nmodel to 70--90% with the vote-first model. This made the team rethink\ntheir plans to develop a mobile application, since mobile applications\ncouldn’t compete with the cross-platform ubiquity and immediacy of\nemail.

They implement features and tactics to try to increase user acquisition\nas much as possible, before really understanding what those users will do.\nThis is common for two reasons:\n\n• First, the bar for success in a consumer application is always going up.\nA few years ago, hundreds of thousands of users was considered big.\nToday, 1 million users is the benchmark, but it’s quickly going to 10\nmillion. That’s a lot of users. Certain categories of product, such as\nsocial networks and e-commerce, are ossifying, with a few gigantic\nplayers competing and leaving little room for upstarts.\n\n• Second, many consumer applications rely on network effects. The more\nusers, the more value created for everyone. Nobody wants to use the\ntelephone when they’re the only one with a telephone. Location-based\napplications typically require lots of scale, as do most marketplaces and\nuser-generated content businesses, so that there are enough transactions\nand discussions to make things interesting. Without a critical mass of\nusers, Facebook is an empty shell. Reaching this critical mass quickly is\nthe first step in delivering the anticipated value of the product.\n\nAs a result, founders of consumer startups and multiplayer games often\nargue that they need to focus on virality and user acquisition because it will\nsolve all their other problems.

By the time they go back and try to recover those users, they’re\ngone. You never get a second chance to have a first enrollment.\n\nthe goal Is Retention\n\nThe more engaged that people are with your product (and potentially other\nusers of your product), the more likely they’ll stay. By ignoring growth from\nvirality (for now), you can simplify how you decide what to build next into\nyour MVP. Ask yourself, “Do we believe that the feature we want to build\n(or the feature we want to change) will improve stickiness?” Put the feature\naside if the answer is “no.” But if the answer is “yes,” figure out how to test\nthat belief and start building the feature.\n\nPattern | Seven Questions to Ask yourself Before\n\nBuilding a Feature\n\nYou probably have a long list of feature ideas you believe will improve\nretention. You need to further prioritize. Here are seven questions you\ncan ask yourself (and your team) before building a new feature.\n\n1 . Why Will It Make things Better?\n\nYou can’t build a feature without having a reason for building it. In the\nStickiness stage, your focus is retention. Look at your potential feature\nlist and ask yourself, “Why do I think this will improve retention?”\n\nYou’ll be tempted to copy what others are doing---say, using\ngamification to drive engagement (and in turn retention)---just\nbecause it looks like it’s working for the competition. Don’t. Qidiq\nignored common wisdom around the sign-up process and the creation\nof a mobile app and quadrupled engagement. It’s OK to copy existing\npatterns, but know why you’re doing so.\n\nAsking “Why will it make it better?” forces you to write out (on paper!)\na hypothesis.

{"segment_id": "00235", "page_num": 235, "segment": "2 . Can you Measure the Effect of the Feature?\n\nFeature experiments require that you measure the impact of the feature.\nThat impact has to be quantifiable. Too often, features get added to a\nproduct without any quantifiable validation---which is a direct path\ntoward scope creep and feature bloat.\n\nIf you’re unable to quantify the impact of a new feature, you can’t\nassess its value, and you won’t really know what to do with the feature\nover time. If this is the case, leave it as is, iterate on it, or kill it.\n\n3 . How Long Will the Feature take to Build?\n\nTime is a precious resource you never get back. You have to compare\nthe relative development time of each feature on your list. If something\nis going to take months to build, you need good confidence that it will\nhave a significant impact. Can you break it into smaller parts, or test\nthe inherent risk with a curated MVP or a prototype instead?\n\n4 . Will the Feature Overcomplicate things?\n\nComplexity kills products. It’s most obvious in the user experience of\nmany web applications: they become so convoluted and confusing that\nusers leave for a simpler alternative.\n\n“And” is the enemy of success. When discussing a feature with your\nteam, pay attention to how it’s being described. “The feature will allow\nyou to do this, and it’d be great if it did this other thing, and this other\nthing, and this other thing too.” Warning bells should be going off\nat this point. If you’re trying to justify a feature by saying it satisfies\nseveral needs a little bit, know that it’s almost always better to satisfy\none need in an absolutely epic, remarkable way.\n\nOne mobile analytics expert for an adult-content site told us his rule\nfor new features is simple: “If you can’t do it in three taps with one\nhand, it’s broken.” Knowing your user’s behavior and expectations\nis everything. Having feature complexity get in the way of the real\ntesting you need to do around your market, customer acquisition, and\nretention is extremely painful.\n\n5 . How Much Risk Is there in this new Feature?\n\nBuilding new features always comes with some amount of risk. There’s\ntechnical risk related to how a feature may impact the code base.\nThere’s user risk in terms of how people might respond to the feature.\nThere’s also risk in terms of how a new feature drives future development,\npotentially setting you on a path you don’t want to pursue.\n\nCHAPter 16: StAge two: StICKIneSS\n\n209", "source_file": "Lean_Analytics.pdf", "extraction_method": "pdfminer", "ocr_used": false, "has_table": false, "chapter_num": "11", "chapter_title": "MoDeL FoUr: MeDIA SIte", "section_num": null, "section_title": null, "l1_summary": "Can you Measure the Effect of the Feature?

Analytics helps\nbreak that bond so that you can measure things honestly and make the\nbest decisions possible, with the most information available.\n\n6 . How Innovative Is the new Feature?\n\nNot everything you do will be innovative. Most features aren’t\ninnovative, they’re small tweaks to a product in the hope that the whole\nis more valuable than the individual parts.\n\nBut consider innovation when prioritizing feature development;\ngenerally, the easiest things to do rarely have a big impact. You’re still\nin the Stickiness stage, trying to find the right product. Changing a\nsubmit button from red to blue may result in a good jump in signup\nconversions (a classic A/B test), but it’s probably not going to turn your\nbusiness from a failure into a giant success; it’s also easy for others to\ncopy.\n\nIt’s better to make big bets, swing for the fences, try more radical\nexperiments, and build more disruptive things, particularly since you\nhave fewer user expectations to contend with than you will later on.\n\n7 . What Do users Say they Want?\n\nYour users are important. Their feedback is important. But relying on\nwhat they say is risky. Be careful about over-prioritizing based on user\ninput alone. Users lie, and they don’t like hurting your feelings.\n\nPrioritizing feature development during an MVP isn’t an exact science.\nUser actions speak louder than words. Aim for a genuinely testable\nhypothesis for every feature you build, and you’ll have a much better\nchance of quickly validating success or failure. Simply tracking how\npopular various features are within the application will reveal what’s\nworking and what’s not. Looking at what feature a user was using\nbefore he hit “undo” or the back button will pinpoint possible problem\nareas.\n\nBuilding features is easy if you plan them beforehand and truly understand\nwhy you’re doing something. It’s important to tie your high-level vision and\nlong-term goals down to the feature level. Without that alignment, you run\nthe risk of building features that can’t be properly tested and don’t drive\nthe business forward.\n\n210\n\nPArt two: FInDIng tHe rIgHt MetrIC For rIgHt now", "source_file": "Lean_Analytics.pdf", "extraction_method": "pdfminer", "ocr_used": false, "has_table": false, "chapter_num": "11", "chapter_title": "MoDeL FoUr: MeDIA SIte", "section_num": null, "section_title": null, "l1_summary": "How Innovative Is the new Feature?

We spoke with Chief Technologist Zach Nies\nabout how the company continues to successfully build its products.\n\nEstablishing a Company Vision\n\nEverything at Rally starts with a three- to five-year company vision\nthat is refreshed every 18 months. The entire company aligns around\nthe vision, which is the first waypoint in turning a big, distant goal\ninto something more attainable. This longer-term vision becomes a\nkey input into annual planning each year. Zach says, “When we were\nyounger and smaller we didn’t bother looking three years into the\nfuture, but it’s an important part of the process for a company of our\nsize.”\n\nAnnual planning is initially done by a small group of executives. Zach\ncalls this the first iteration. The output of the initial planning is a draft\ncorporate strategy, which provides a clear, concise picture of Rally’s\nperformance gaps and targets, reflections, and rationale for the year.\nThe executive team also identifies three or four high-level places where\nthey believe the company needs to focus action to accomplish the\nannual vision. “This work creates a draft of ideas to bring back to\nRally for reflection,” Zach says. “They provide a summary of what the\nexecutive group saw as critically valuable to address in our upcoming\nyear.”\n\nThe second iteration of annual planning takes the form of departmental\nannual retrospectives. Rally uses an approach called ORID (Objective,\nReflective, Interpretive, Decisional) from The Art of Focused\nConversation by R. Brian Stanfield (New Society Publishers).* Zach\nsays:\n\nThis process invites insights from all employees, and provides\na valuable narrative about the past, present, and future. From\neach ORID within each department, we learn about completed\nwork, the current work in progress, planned work, specific\nannual metrics, the implications for the coming year, and the\noverall mood for the year. Kids are learning machines, but adults\n\n*\n\n http:///Art-Focused-Conversation-Access-Workplace/dp/0865714169\n\nCHAPter 16: StAge two: StICKIneSS\n\n211", "source_file": "Lean_Analytics.pdf", "extraction_method": "pdfminer", "ocr_used": false, "has_table": false, "chapter_num": "11", "chapter_title": "MoDeL FoUr: MeDIA SIte", "section_num": null, "section_title": null, "l1_summary": "Establishing a Company Vision Everything at Rally starts with a three- to five-year company vision\nthat is refreshed every 18 months.

A big part of this is aligning the directions of the company\nand product. The product team focuses on answering the question\n“Why?” above everything else. “The articulation of why we’re doing\nsomething, and always questioning our focus, rallies everyone around\none compelling vision, company, and product, and creates a vital\nemotional connection with our customers,” Zach says. “Only once we\nunderstand ‘why’ can we really look at ‘what’ and ‘how’.”\n\nNow Rally is ready to dig into product. While this process may seem\nlike a lot, it’s very iterative and Lean. The company goes through a\nbuild→measure→learn cycle at several levels before getting to the point\nwhere it’s actually developing features.\n\nDeciding What to Build\n\nFeature development begins in earnest with deciding what to build and\nhow to build it. Rally has an open, but process-oriented, way of making\nfeature decisions. Each quarter, employees submit short proposals for\nchanges to the company’s product direction. These proposals come\nfrom anyone in the organization, but are typically highly influenced by\ninteractions with customers.\n\nZach says:\n\nWe include almost everyone who does product-managementtype work in the decision-making process, including product\nmarketing, product owners, engineering managers, sales\nleadership, and executives. It may seem like this is quite a bit of\nprocess, but the benefits of everyone’s input and alignment far\noutweigh the 10 or so hours a quarter we spend running the\nprocess. We find strong alignment enables great execution.\n\nRally doesn’t release software, but instead “turns features on for users\nand customers.” Most features have a toggle that allows Rally to turn\nthem on or off for specific customers.

It’s easy to complain about US television programming not\nbeing available overseas; it’s unlikely that those complaining are aware\nof the intricacies of foreign currency exchange, censorship, and copyright\nlicensing. They want their problem solved, but they have little insight into\nhow to solve it the right way.\n\nLaura Klein is a user experience (UX) professional and consultant, as well\nas the author of UX for Lean Startups (forthcoming from O’Reilly), part\nof the Lean Series along with this book.

That’s just the way it goes.\nEven if people are using your product, you have good engagement metrics,\nand your product is sticky, they’re still going to complain.

He says, “If you’re trying to build a great\ncompany and get others involved, it’s not enough to find an MVP---you\nneed an MVV, too.”\n\nA minimum viable vision (MVV) is one that captivates. It scales. It has\npotential. It’s audacious and compelling. As a founder, you have to hold\nthat huge, hairy, world-changing vision in one hand, and the practical,\npragmatic, seat-of-the-pants reality in the other. The MVV you need in\norder to get funding demands a convincing explanation of how you can\nbecome a dominant, disruptive player in your market.\n\nHere are some signs that suggest you’ve got the makings of an MVV:\n\n• You’re building a platform. If you’re creating an environment in which\nother things can be created, this is a good sign. Google Maps was just\none of the many mapping tools available, alongside MapQuest and\nothers, but Google made it easy to embed and annotate those maps,\nleading to thousands of mashups and clever uses. It quickly became the\nde facto platform for entry-level geographic information systems (GIS),\nand all those annotations made its maps even more useful.\n\n• You have recurring ways to make money. It’s one thing to take money\nfrom someone once, but if you can convince that person to pay every\nmonth as well, you’re onto something. Just look at Blizzard’s revenues\nfrom World of Warcraft: purchase of the paid desktop client is a\nfraction of the money the company makes compared to revenue from\n$14.95 per month subscriber fees.\n\n• You’ve got naturally tiered pricing. If you can find ways for customers\nto self-upsell, as companies like 37Signals, Wufoo, and FreshBooks\nhave done, then you can hook your users on basic features and tempt\nthem with an upgrade path that adds functionality as they need it. This\nmeans you’ll not only add revenue from new users, but from existing\nones, too.\n\n• You’re tied to a disruptive change. If you’re part of a growing trend---\npeople sharing information, mobile devices, cloud computing---then\nyou’ve got a better chance of growth. A rising tide floats all boats, and\na rising tech sector floats all valuations and exits.\n\n• Adopters automatically become advocates.

Ben met one of the founders there, Ryan Vaughn, when\nspeaking at a conference in 2012. The company’s platform makes it\neasy for athletic directors to manage social communication, creating\nhyper-local media coverage about athletics at their high schools. The\ngoal is to leverage that awareness creation into ongoing financial and\nemotional support for high school sports.\n\nRyan was introduced to the Problem-Solution Canvas and started\nusing it immediately with his board of directors. “We had just raised\nfinancing and had to solve a number of key business problems very\nquickly,” said Ryan. “We used the Problem-Solution Canvas to get all\nour board members on the same page, focused on what we had to do\nin order to move forward.”\n\nVNN followed a Lean process, particularly in the beginning of the\ncompany in order to determine its value proposition and how that\ntied into producing content about high school sports. The company\nremains Lean today, testing and iterating each new feature or initiative\nit launches, measuring effectiveness and value creation.\n\nStill, Ryan was concerned that his board wouldn’t embrace the ProblemSolution Canvas. He said, “The Lean Startup process has not been\nwidely adopted in the Midwest yet, but our board had been exposed to\nthe methodology, which helped speed up our initial progress with the\ncanvas.”\n\nVNN used the canvas for a few months, during a critical time of\nproblem solving.

In reality, as David points out, it’s unlikely that users will continue\nto invite their friends as time goes by---instead, they’ll invite those friends\nwho they think are relevant and then stop inviting, and many of those they\ninvite will have the same groups of friends. The invitation roster will get\nsaturated.\n\nThere’s another factor to consider here: cycle time. If it takes only a day\nfor someone to use the site and invite others, you’ll see fast growth.

Each of them will have\ndifferent conversion rates, and users who come from each kind of growth\nwill have different engagement levels. That’ll tell you where to focus your\nefforts.\n\nThe metrics that matter in the virality phase are about outreach and new\nuser adoption. While the most fundamental of these is the viral coefficient,\nyou can also measure the volume of invites sent by a user, or the time it\ntakes her to invite someone.\n\nFor companies selling to an enterprise market, where click-to-invite virality\nisn’t the norm, there are other metrics that might work better.

Maybe it’s a change in pricing, or a time-limited offer, or a form of\npersonalization. The point is to experiment in a disciplined manner.\n\nProduct-focused growth hacks---what Chamath Palihapitiya calls “aha\nmoments”---need to happen early in the user’s lifecycle in order to have\nan impact on the greatest number of possible users. That’s why social sites\nsuggest friends for you almost immediately.\n\nYou can use promotions and experiments to try to identify a leading\nindicator, too. Music retailer Beatport ran a Cyber Monday promotion to\nmaximize total purchases. A week before the holiday, it sent all its customers\na 10% discount code. Those customers who purchased something with\nthe code were then sent a second, personalized code for 20% off. If they\nused that code, they were sent a final, one-time-only, time-limited code\nfor Cyber Monday that gave them 50% off their purchase. This approach\nincreased purchase frequency, and encouraged customers to max out their\nshopping cart each time.\n\nWhile we don’t have data on the effectiveness of the campaign itself, it’s clear\nthat the company now has a wealth of information on who will respond\nbest to a promotion and how discounts relate to purchase volume---and it’s\nmade its loyal customers feel loved as well.\n\nGrowth hacking combines many of the disciplines we’ve looked at in the\nbook: finding a business model, identifying the most important metric for\nyour current stage, and constantly learning and optimizing that metric to\ncreate a better future for your organization.\n\nA Summary of the Virality Stage\n\n• Virality refers to the spread of a message from existing, “infected”\n\nusers to new users.\n\n• If every user successfully invites more than one other user, your growth\nis almost assured. While this is seldom the case, any word of mouth\nadds to customer growth and reduces your overall customer acquisition\ncosts.\n\n• Inherent virality happens naturally as users interact with your product.\nArtificial virality is incentivized and less genuine. And word of mouth,\nwhile hard to create and track, drives a lot of early adoption. You need\nto segment users who come from all three kinds of virality.\n\n• In addition to viral coefficient, you care about viral cycle time.

While no\nbusiness is as clear-cut as the penny machine, every CEO needs to make his\nbusiness model as straightforward as possible, particularly to outsiders, so\nit’s painfully obvious why the venture will yield revenues.\n\nThe entrepreneur had reasonable answers to key questions: how big can the\nbusiness grow, how good can the margins get, and what kinds of barriers\nto entry does it have?\n\nThe presenter engaged the audience, and let them help her tell the story.\nThey were smart people who asked the questions she wanted, and she\nshowed them that she’d anticipated their questions by providing slightly\nmore detail than they asked for without going into too much depth.\n\nCHAPter 18: StAge FoUr: reVenUe\n\n243", "source_file": "Lean_Analytics.pdf", "extraction_method": "pdfminer", "ocr_used": false, "has_table": false, "chapter_num": "11", "chapter_title": "MoDeL FoUr: MeDIA SIte", "section_num": null, "section_title": null, "l1_summary": "“How many pennies can I put in there per hour?” he asks. “Can I put\nnickels into it?” he inquires.

Later,\nthe investors would certainly go over the technology carefully to ensure\nthat it wasn’t illegal, immoral, or outright trickery. But this meeting wasn’t\nabout that. Opening the machine up served as a simple proof that everyone\nin the room understood well enough.\n\nThe entrepreneur didn’t set a valuation. She gave the investors all the details\nthey needed to form one of their own, based on revenue potential, margin,\ncosts, and so on.

In a SaaS company, you\nspend money on sales and marketing in the hopes that you’ll sign up new\ncustomers. If all goes well, the following quarter your revenues will have\nincreased.\n\nTo measure the health of the machine, divide how much you changed the\nannual recurring revenue in the past quarter by what it cost you to do so.\nYou need three numbers to do this calculation:\n\n• Your quarterly recurring revenue for quarter x (QRR[x])\n\n• Your quarterly recurring revenue for the quarter before x (QRR[x -- 1])\n\n• Your sales and marketing expense for the quarter before x (QExpSM[x\n\n-- 1])\n\nIf you don’t have quarterly sales and marketing spending, you can take the\nannual spending and divide it by four.

It was first launched in 2009\nout of Philadelphia’s Dreamit Ventures as a reader tool for consumers\nto find stories they’d like. A year later, the company changed its\napproach: since it knew what a reader might like to read next, it could\nhelp publishers suggest content that would keep readers on the site for\nlonger. And in 2011, it changed again, this time offering reporting tools\nto publishers who wanted to know what was working. The current\nproduct, Parse.ly Dash, is an analytics tool for publishers.*\n\nWhile Dash is a successful product today, the company had to abandon\nits earlier work in its search for a sustainable business model. “It was\nvery hard for us to shift away from our consumer newsreader product.\nThat’s because all the metrics were actually quite positive,” says Mike\nSukmanowsky, Parse.ly’s Product Lead.\n\n“We had thousands of users and the product was growing rapidly.\nWe were written up in top technology press like TechCrunch,\nReadWriteWeb, and ZDNet. The product worked and we had a million\nideas for how to improve it even further. However, it was lacking one\ncritical metric for any growing business---revenue. We ran tests and\nsurveys, and learned that though our users loved Parse.ly Reader, they\ndidn’t love it so much that they’d be willing to pay for it.”\n\nThe founders had plenty of code, but no revenue, and costs were growing.\nMike attributes part of this to the focus that startup accelerators have\n\n* the Parse.ly team has written a detailed explanation of these changes at http://blog.parse.ly/\n\npost/16388310218/hello-publishers-meet-dash.\n\nCHAPter 18: StAge FoUr: reVenUe\n\n247", "source_file": "Lean_Analytics.pdf", "extraction_method": "pdfminer", "ocr_used": false, "has_table": false, "chapter_num": "11", "chapter_title": "MoDeL FoUr: MeDIA SIte", "section_num": null, "section_title": null, "l1_summary": "• The revenue you bring in from users The current\nproduct, Parse.ly Dash, is an analytics tool for publishers.* “We had thousands of users and the product was growing rapidly.", "l2_summary": "• The revenue you bring in from users • The rate of churn from users Case st udy | Parse .ly and the Pivot to Revenue The current\nproduct, Parse.ly Dash, is an analytics tool for publishers.* “We had thousands of users and the product was growing rapidly.

It’s where you find\nout what you’ll be when you grow up.\n\nMetrics for the Scale Stage\n\nThis stage is where you look beyond your own company. If you focus too\nearly on competitors, you can be blinded by what they’re doing, rather than\nlearning what your customers actually need. But by now, you have enough\nof a groove to look outside. You’ll find that it’s a crowded world, where\nyou’re competing with everyone for attention.\n\nWe’ve known that getting enough of the right kind of attention was\ngoing to be a problem for three decades. In 1981, cognitive scientist and\neconomist Herbert Simon observed that we live in an information age,\nand that information consumes attention---in other words, attention is\na precious commodity, and its value grows as we’re flooded with more\nand more information. In this stage, you’re checking whether analysts,\ncompetitors, and distributors care about you as much as your core group\nof initial customers does. Getting attention at scale means your product or\nservice can stand on its own, without your constant love and feeding.\n\nIn the Scale stage, you want to compare higher-order metrics like\nBackupify’s OMTM---customer acquisition payback---across channels,\nregions, and marketing campaigns. For example: is a customer you acquire\nthrough channels less valuable than one you acquire yourself? Does it\ntake longer to pay back direct sales or telemarketing? Are international\nrevenues hampered by taxes? These are signs that you won’t be able to scale\nindependent of your own organizational growth.\n\nIs My Business Model Right?\n\nIn the Scale stage, many of the metrics you’ve used to optimize a particular\npart of the business now become inputs into your accounting system.

As Joel says,\n“We were constrained by our situation: track record and location [being\nbased in New Zealand] made it a challenge to seriously consider raising\nfunding, and I had no funds to dip into and was working full-time for\nother clients. This meant the most important metric was revenue, since\nI needed to grow the revenue in my spare time to a position where I\ncould quit my existing work.”\n\nJoel and his team decided to go with a freemium approach (which they\nstill have today), so along with the all-important metric of revenue,\nthey were looking at other metrics around signups, activation, and\nconversion. “Early on, the most important metrics were activation,\nretention, and revenue,” says Joel. “I think good metrics here are the\nsigns of a solid product. Revenue mattered the most because I was\nliterally calculating how many users we’d need based on our conversion\nin order for me to quit my work. As soon as we hit that amount, we\ngrew faster, and shortly after hitting ‘ramen profitability’ we jumped\non a plane to San Francisco, went through the AngelPad incubator, and\nraised our seed round.”\n\nJoel shared some numbers with us:\n\n• 20% of visitors create an account (acquisition).\n\n• 64% of people who sign up become “active” (which the founders\n\ndefine as posting one status update using Buffer).\n\n• 60% of people who sign up come back in the first month\n\n(engagement/stickiness).\n\n• 20% of people who sign up come back (are still active) after six\n\nmonths (engagement/stickiness).\n\nTheir conversion is between 1.5% and 2.5% from free to paid.

{"segment_id": "00299", "page_num": 299, "segment": "C H A Pt E R 2 1\n\nAm I good Enough?\n\nOne of the biggest questions we wanted to tackle with Lean Analytics is\n“what’s normal?” It’s something we get asked all the time: “How do I know\nwhat’s a normal or ideal value for the metrics I’m tracking? How do I know\nif it’s going well or not? Should I keep optimizing this metric, or move on\nto something else?”\n\nAt the outset, many people cautioned us against trying to find a typical\nvalue for a particular metric. After all, startups are, by definition, trying\nto break the rules, which means the rules are being rewritten all the time.\nBut we think it’s important to try to define “normal” for two big reasons.\n\nFirst, you need to know if you’re in the ballpark. If your current behavior\nis outrageously far from that of everyone else, you should be aware of it.

There’s a line in the sand, a point where you know you’re\nready to move to the next KPI---and most companies aren’t anywhere near\nit.\n\nConsider this: if you get your churn rate below 5%---ideally as low as\n2%---each month, you have a reasonably sticky product. Bjoern’s average\nis between 12% (for indirectly monetized sites) and 19% (for those that\nmonetize directly from users)---nowhere near good enough to move to the\nnext stage.\n\nFurthermore, consumer applications have a nearly 1:1 CAC to CLV ratio.\nThat means they’re spending all the money they make acquiring new users.\nAs we’ve seen, you’re doing well when you spend less than a third of your\ncustomer revenue acquiring new customers. For bigger-ticket applications\n(with a CLV of over $50K) things are less bleak, with most companies\nspending between 0.2% and 2% of CLV on acquisition.\n\nStartup Compass has some great comparative insight, and we encourage\nyou to use it to measure yourself against other companies.

In fact, it’s this growth that distinguishes a\nstartup from other new ventures like a cobbler or a restaurant. Startups, Paul\nsays, go through three distinct growth phases: slow, where the organization\nis searching for a product and market to tackle; fast, where it has figured\nout how to make and sell it at scale; and slow again, as it becomes a big\ncompany and encounters internal constraints or market saturation, and\ntries to overcome Porter’s “hole in the middle.”\n\nAt Paul’s startup accelerator, Y Combinator, teams track growth rate weekly\nbecause of the short timeframe. “A good growth rate during YC is 5--7%\na week,” he says. “If you can hit 10% a week you’re doing exceptionally\nwell. If you can only manage 1%, it’s a sign you haven’t yet figured out\nwhat you’re doing.” If the company is at the Revenue stage, then growth is\nmeasured in revenue; if it’s not charging money yet, growth is measured in\nactive users.\n\nIs growth at All Costs a good thing?\n\nThere’s no question that growth is important. But focusing on growth\ntoo soon is bad. We’ve seen how inherent virality---that’s built into\nyour product’s use---is better than artificial virality you’ve added as an\nafterthought. A flood of new visitors might grow your user base, but might\nalso be detrimental to your business. Similarly, while some kinds of growth\nare good, other kinds aren’t sustainable. Premature scaling, such as firing\nup the paid engine before you’re sticky, can exacerbate issues with product\nquality, cash flow, and user satisfaction. It kills you just as you’re getting\nstarted.\n\nSean Ellis notes that growth hackers are constantly testing and tweaking\nnew ways of achieving growth, but that “during this process it is easy to\nlose sight of the big picture. When this happens, growth eventually falls off\na cliff.” †\n\nHe goes on to say, “Sustainable growth programs are built on a core\nunderstanding of the value of your solution in the minds of your most\npassionate customers.” As we saw in Chapter 5, Sean’s Startup Growth\nPyramid illustrates that scaling your business comes only after you’ve found\n\n* http://paulgraham.com/growth.html\n\n† http://startup-marketing.com/authentic-growth-hacks/\n\nCHAPter 21: AM I gooD enoUgH?\n\n277", "source_file": "Lean_Analytics.pdf", "extraction_method": "pdfminer", "ocr_used": false, "has_table": false, "chapter_num": "11", "chapter_title": "MoDeL FoUr: MeDIA SIte", "section_num": null, "section_title": null, "l1_summary": "“A good growth rate during YC is 5--7%\na week,” he says.

This achieved good traction, with over\n1,000 communities built atop it.\n\nAs Socialight moved into the B2B space, it launched a three-tiered\nfreemium business model. The two paying tiers were called Premium\nand Pro, and cost $250 and $1,000--$5,500 per month, respectively.\nThe main difference between the Premium and Pro offerings was\nthe amount of involvement Socialight had with those customers---at\n$1,000--$5,500 per month, Socialight was very involved with lots of\nhours invested per month to work with customers.\n\nFour months into its freemium launch, the company realized there was a\nproblem.

Moreover, Pro customers took a lot longer to close, which is not\nsomething we understood well enough early on,” says Dan.\n\nThis is where a greater understanding and sophistication around pricerelated metrics becomes so important.

Eventually, the\ncompany increased the Pro tier to $5,500/month exclusively, a reflection\nof the increased support required by customers.\n\nSocialight never got around to experimenting with different pricing\nstrategies (it was acquired, after all!), but Dan would have liked to. “I\nthink we could have reduced the Pro feature set a small amount and\nreduced its pricing significantly,” he says.\n\nThis underscores the tricky balance in a freemium or tiered pricing\nmodel: how do you make sure that the features/services being offered fit\ninto the right packages at the right price?

Price is an important tool\nfor getting your customers to do what you want, and it should always\nbe compared not only to cost of sales, but also to cost of goods sold\nand marginal cost.\n\nResearch on price elasticity suggests that it applies most in young, growing\nmarkets. Think about getting a walk-in haircut, for example. You may not\ncheck how much the haircut is; you know it’ll be within a certain price\nrange. If the stylist presented you with a bill for $500, you’d be outraged.\nThere’s a well-defined expectation of pricing. While startups often live in\nyoung, growing markets where prices are less established, bigger, more\nstable markets are often subject to commodity pricing, regulation, bulk\ndiscounts, long-term contracts, and other externalities that complicate the\nsimplicity of the elasticity just described.\n\nYour business model will affect the role pricing plays for you. If you’re\na media site, someone is already optimizing revenue for you in the form\nof ad auctions. If you’re a two-sided marketplace, you may need to help\nyour sellers price their offerings correctly in order to maximize your own\nprofits. And if you’re a UGC site, you may not care about pricing---or may\nwant to apply similar approaches to determine the most effective rewards\nor incentives for your users.\n\nIn a study of 133 companies, Patrick Campbell found that most respondents\ncompared themselves to the competition when setting pricing, as shown\nin Figure 21-2.

There’s no “normal” for virality. Both\nmetrics depend on the nature of your product, as well as market saturation.\n\nA sustained viral coefficient of greater than 1 is an extremely strong\nindicator of growth, and suggests that you should be focusing on stickiness\nso you can retain those new users as you add them.

Chris Anderson, former editor-in-chief of\nWired and author of The Long Tail (Hyperion), observes that King Gillette\npioneered the idea of giving something away (handles) to make money on\nsomething else (razor blades).* But in many ways, online users have strong\nexpectations that the Internet should be free, which means it’s hard to\ncharge even for valuable things.\n\nDetractors of freemium models observe that for every success like Dropbox\nor LinkedIn, there’s a deadpool of others who went out of business giving\nthings away.

For other sites, it’ll vary depending on how you define\n“disengaged.” Mark MacLeod, Partner at Real Ventures, says that you\nneed to get below a 5% monthly churn rate before you know you’ve got\na business that’s ready to scale. Remember, though, if you’re surprising\nyour subscribers in a bad way (e.g., billing them for something they didn’t\nknow they’d ordered), then churn will spike during your first billing period,\nsometimes to 50%, so you should factor this into your calculations.\n\nDavid Skok agrees with the 5% churn threshold, but only for early-stage\ncompanies, and says that you have to see a clear path to getting churn\nbelow 2% if you want to scale significantly:\n\nIn the early days of a SaaS business, churn really doesn’t matter\nthat much. Let’s say you lose 3% of your customers every month.\nWhen you only have a hundred customers, losing three of them is\nnot that terrible. You can easily go and find another three to replace\nthem.

Its service provides searchable cloud storage coupled with\ndownloadable apps that allow businesses to sync, scan, search, and\nshare files anywhere at any time. Currently, over 180,000 users store\ndata in the service, and its subscribers access and upload millions of\nfiles each month.\n\nThe company offers its solution as a freemium model with one free plan\nand three paid plans. We spoke with Healy Jones, Vice President of\nMarketing, to learn more about the company’s key metrics and lessons\nlearned.\n\n“Our most important number is paid churn,” says Healy. OfficeDrop\ndefines paid churn as the number of paying users who downgrade to\nfree or cancel divided by the total number of paying users available to\nchurn at the beginning of the month.\n\nFor OfficeDrop, paid churn is a key indicator of the business’s overall\nhealth. “For example, we can tell how our marketing messaging is doing\nbased on paid user churn---if a lot of new customers churn out, then\nwe know our messaging doesn’t match what the customers are actually\nfinding when they start using the product,” explains Healy. “We can\nalso tell if our feature development is progressing in the direction that\nolder users want: if they stick around for a long time then we are doing\na good job, but if they churn out fast then we are not developing the\nproduct in the direction that they want. We can also tell if any bugs\nare causing people to be upset---if a lot of users cancel on a particular\nday, then we have to look and see if there was a technical problem that\nticked people off.”\n\nThe company aims for a monthly churn rate below 4%. “Three percent\nis good,” Healy says. “Anything over 5% and we really don’t have\na business that will generate gross margin positive growth.” Most\nrecently, Healy says the company has been hitting a churn rate of 2%\nand hopes to maintain that.\n\nAs is often the case, churn is the inverse of engagement, and this is the\nsecond key metric for OfficeDrop. It defines an active user as someone\nwho used the product in the previous month. When OfficeDrop\nlaunched, the founders assumed that people would not want to install\nprograms on their computers or devices, that they would want a rich\nbrowser experience instead. “We did everything by our gut, and almost\neverything was wrong,” says Healy. “We hypothesized that the browser\nexperience---which is the easiest to get started with and has the lowest\n\n306\n\nPArt tHree: LIneS In tHe SAnD", "source_file": "Lean_Analytics.pdf", "extraction_method": "pdfminer", "ocr_used": false, "has_table": false, "chapter_num": "11", "chapter_title": "MoDeL FoUr: MeDIA SIte", "section_num": null, "section_title": null, "l1_summary": "Case st udy | OfficeDrop’s Key Metric: Paid Churn “Our most important number is paid churn,” says Healy.

You also need to track how quickly users pay back the cost of\nacquiring them, as well as their lifetime value. Test different channels\nand track user behavior, and use virality as a means of lowering your\nacquisition costs.\n\nApplication Launch Rate\n\nSimply downloading an application isn’t enough. Users have to launch it,\nand some wait a long time to do so. In addition to the size constraints\noutlined previously, multiple tablets and phones connected to a single\naccount may download the application at different times, skewing your\nlaunch analytics. In other words: it’s complicated.\n\nFor free applications, many downloaders are just browsing applications\ncasually and haven’t committed to a particular game or application and the\nrelated in-game purchases, so a higher percentage of downloads are never\nlaunched. For example, Massive Damage sees roughly 83% of downloads\nfor its flagship game, Please Stay Calm, lead to an application launch.\n\nBottom Line\n\nExpect a significant number of downloads to never launch your application,\nparticularly if it’s a free app.\n\nPercent Active Mobile users/Players\n\nWhen it comes to inactivity, the first day is always the worst. There’s a\ngradual decline in active users over time, but the first day decline can be\nas high as 80%.

So how can you use this information?\n\n• Look at the outliers. “If a page has a large number of visitors and\na low engaged time, think about why people are leaving quickly.\nDid they come expecting something else? Is the layout working?\nOr is it simply a page that isn’t designed to keep users for long?”\nasks Joshua.\n\n• Show off your good stuff. If a page has a high engaged time but few\n\nvisitors, consider promoting it to a wider audience.\n\n• Ensure that the purpose of the page matches the engagement. “If\nyou’re an e-commerce site, you might want your landing page to\nhave little engagement time,” says Joshua. “But if you’re producing\neditorial content, you should aim for high engaged time on article\npages.”\n\nSharing with Others\n\n(Sharing with others also applies to UGC sites)\n\nSharing is the word-of-mouth form of virality.

The original\nplan was to create a dedicated website, relying heavily on Adobe Flash,\nthat featured Just For Laughs content including stand-up and Gags.\n“Once that fell through, the team at Gags decided to concentrate on\nYouTube,” says Carlos. “Even though the channel had been a YouTube\npartner since 2009, it was only in early 2011 that the producers started\nto notice some revenue coming from the few videos that were there.”\nWith the hypothesis that more videos would lead to more revenue, the\nteam uploaded over 2,000 prank clips to the site.\n\nSince its creation, Gags was formatted for television, which meant a\nhalf-hour show (with commercial breaks) featuring 12 to 14 pranks. On\nYouTube, the half-hour constraints were gone. In many ways, the short\nformat of a single prank was more suited to the Web than television.\n“The mass upload wasn’t done very strategically,” says Carlos, “but\nout of the 2,000 videos, a few got noticed and went viral, helping the\nchannel grow, and ad revenue became significant in early 2012.”\n\ngetting the Ad Balance Right\n\nOn YouTube, content owners can run ads in several ways. They can\ncreate overlays atop the video with clickable links, and they can screen\nads before, during, or after the content. The content provider can also\ndecide whether ads can be skipped or not. The right ad strategy is critical;\nmore impressions and more ads means more revenue (measured in cost\nper engagement, or CPE---the revenue earned from an ad impression),\nbut those ads can turn viewers away.\n\nInitially the only metrics the team looked at were daily views and\nrevenue. Now they’re getting much more sophisticated, looking at\nmetrics such as time watched per video, traffic sources, playback\nlocations, demographics, annotations, and audience retention. A key\ngoal is to analyze where people drop off from watching, which helps\nguide Carlos on the right formats for videos.\n\n“For example, a few months ago we started producing web exclusive\n‘best of Gags’ videos,” says Carlos. “The first videos featured a 10to 15-second intro animation, but looking at the audience retention\nwe saw a 30% drop-off within the first 15 seconds. After that, we\nmodified the initial uploads and all future uploads to remove the intros,\nwhich gave our audience the content they really wanted as soon as they\npressed play.”\n\nEarly on, Gags used only overlay ads on its content.

For example, if you have a link-sharing site,\nyou might time how long it takes a user to return from viewing a link and\nuse that as a measurement of the link’s quality---the user wouldn’t have to\nrate the link. Any attempt to optimize contribution and engagement would\nthen become a hypothesis for testing.\n\nNielsen’s ratio is changing as web use becomes part of our daily lives. A\n2012 BBC study of online engagement showed that 77% of the UK’s online\npopulation is participating online, partly due to the ubiquity of the Internet\nas a social platform and how easy it is to participate lazily, by uploading a\npicture or updating a status.†\n\nThe Altimeter Group’s Charlene Li has done a lot of research into engagement.\nHer engagement pyramid details several kinds of user engagement.

For many of the UGC\ncompanies we spoke with---such as Community Connect and reddit---\nfraudulent content is a very real problem that requires constant analysis\nand a significant engineering investment. In addition to algorithms and\nmachine heuristics, companies like Google and Facebook pay people fulltime to screen content for criminal or objectionable material, which can be\na grueling job.* Jeremy Edberg estimates that 50% of reddit’s development\ntime focused on stopping spam and vote cheating---although for the first\n18 months of the site’s life, user voting was enough to block all spam, and\nthere was no spam protection in place.\n\nSpammers often create one-time accounts, which are easy to spot. Hijacked\naccounts are harder to pinpoint, but most UGC sites allow users to flag\nspammy content, which makes it easier to review. But despite the promise\nof a self-policing community, users aren’t a good way to find bad content.\nMany of the posts flagged on reddit were actually spammers flagging\neveryone else in the hopes of boosting their own content. At reddit, “we\nhad to build a system to analyze the quality of the reports per user (how\nmany reports ultimately turned into verified spam),” says Jeremy.\n\nAt reddit, automated filters, along with moderators, catch most of the\nspam---which, in 2011, represented about half of all submitted content.\n“That 50% comes from far less than 50% of the users,” says Jeremy.\n“Pretty much the way all the anti-cheating was developed was by finding a\ncase of a cheater who was successful, analyzing why they were successful,\nfinding other examples in the corpus, and then developing a model to find\nthat type of cheating.”\n\nUltimately, spam suggested the site’s advertising revenue model, too. “We\nfigured spammers were trying to get their links seen though cheating; why\nnot just let them pay and then make it obvious they paid?” recalls Jeremy.\n“If you look at the sponsored link today, you’ll see that the styling and\nexecution is almost identical to how Google highlighted sponsored links\naround 2008.”\n\nBottom Line\n\nExpect to spend a significant amount of time and money fighting spam\nas you become more popular.

They might have time for coffee. They have\nbudgets. And for many of the people in these organizations, it’s part of their\njob to evaluate new solutions, meet with vendors, and share their needs to\nsee if someone can solve them more explicitly. Armed with a decent caffeine\nallowance, you can talk to actual prospects fairly quickly.\n\nThat said, there are plenty of important ways that enterprise sales are\ndifferent and more difficult than selling to a large, unwashed audience.\nVenture capitalist Ben Horowitz was one of the first to burst this bubble:\n\nEvery day I hear from entrepreneurs, angel investors, and\nventure capitalists about an exciting new movement called “the\nconsumerization of the enterprise.” They tell me how the old,\nexpensive, Rolex-wearing sales forces are a thing of the past and,\nin the future, companies will “consume” enterprise products\nproactively like consumers pick up Twitter.\n\nBut when I talk to the most successful new enterprise companies like\nWorkDay, Apptio, Jive, Zuora, and Cloudera, they all employ serious\nand large enterprise sales efforts that usually include expensive\npeople, some of whom indeed wear Rolex watches.*\n\nBig ticket, High touch\n\nThe one thing that makes enterprise-focused startups different is this: B2C\ncustomer development is polling, B2B customer development is a census.\n\nIn most cases, enterprise sales involve bigger-ticket items, sold to fewer\ncustomers.

The high sale price offsets the cost of a\ndirect sales approach, particularly in the early stages of the sale.\n\nThe small number of initial users makes an even bigger difference. You\naren’t talking to a sample of 30 people as a proxy for the market at large.\nInstead, you’re talking to 30 companies who may well become your first 30\ncustomers.\n\nMuch of analytics is about trying to understand large amounts of\ninformation so you can get a better grasp of underlying patterns and act on\n\n* http://bhorowitz.com/2010/11/15/meet-the-new-enterprise-customer-he%E2%80%99s-a-lot-likethe-old-enterprise-customer/\n\n354\n\nPArt FoUr: PUttIng LeAn AnALYtICS to worK", "source_file": "Lean_Analytics.pdf", "extraction_method": "pdfminer", "ocr_used": false, "has_table": false, "chapter_num": "26", "chapter_title": "USer-generAteD Content: LIneS In tHe SAnD", "section_num": null, "section_title": null, "l1_summary": "Why Are Enterprise Customers Different?

But in the early stages of a B2B startup, there aren’t patterns---there\nare just customers.\n\n• You can pick up the phone and call them right away.\n\n• They’ll call you and tell you what they want.\n\n• You can get in a room with them.\n\n• You can’t test something on a statistically significant sample of the\n\npopulation and write it off if the test fails---you’ll lose customers.\n\nFormality\n\nEnterprise buyers tend to be more regulated. They can’t make decisions\non gut or emotion---or rather, they can, but it has to be justified with a\nbusiness case. Big companies are often public companies with checks and\nbalances. The person who pays for the product (finance) isn’t the person\nwho uses it (the line of business). Understanding this dichotomy is critical\nfor product development and sales. Initially, you may target early adopters,\nwhere the buyer is much closer to the user (they may be the same person at\nthis point), but as you move past early adopters, the buyer and user diverge.\n\nCompanies have formal structure for good reasons. It helps prevent\ncorruption, and makes auditing possible. But that structure gets in the way\nof understanding things. Your contact at a company may be a proponent,\nbut someone else in the organization may be a detractor, or have a concern\nof which you’re not aware. This is one of the reasons direct sales is common\nin early stages: it lets you navigate the bureaucracy and understand the part\nof the sales process that’s hidden to outsiders.\n\nLegacy Products\n\nConsumers can ditch their old product on a whim. Small businesses\ncan migrate fairly easily, as the recent exodus to cloud-based software\ndemonstrates. Large companies, on the other hand, have a significant\ncapital investment in the past which must be properly depreciated. They\nalso have a significant political investment in past decisions, and often this\nis the strongest opposition to change.\n\nMost organizations of any real size have developed their own software\nand processes, and they expect you to adapt to them. They won’t change\nhow they work: change is hard, and retraining is a cost. This can increase\nyour deployment costs, because you have to integrate with what’s already\nin place.

If you’re trying\nto sell to them, and your product is still in the early stages of the technology\nadoption cycle, you’re penalized simply for being new.

But these companies needed only a fraction\nof that capacity.\n\nNetworkshop built a virtualized front-end\ninfrastructure that\ncustomers could buy one Mbps at a time. It deployed this in a single\ndata center in one city, and offered fractional capacity to customers in\nthat data center. The economics were good: once the infrastructure had\nexceeded 35% utilization by customers, every additional dollar went\nstraight to the bottom line.\n\nArmed with this example, Networkshop changed its name to Coradiant\nand closed Series A funding, using the proceeds to deploy similar “pods”\nof infrastructure in data centers throughout North America. Wrapping\nthis in support services, the company joined firms like LoudCloud and\nSiteSmith in the growing managed service provider (MSP) business.\n\nWithin a few years, however, the data center owners with whom\nCoradiant had colocated realized that they needed to make more\n\n* Full disclosure: Coradiant was co-founded by Alistair Croll and eric Packman in 1997 as\n\nnetworkshop; the name was changed to Coradiant in mid-2000.\n\n† http:///hypermail/9905/1667.html\n\n360\n\nPArt FoUr: PUttIng LeAn AnALYtICS to worK", "source_file": "Lean_Analytics.pdf", "extraction_method": "pdfminer", "ocr_used": false, "has_table": false, "chapter_num": "26", "chapter_title": "USer-generAteD Content: LIneS In tHe SAnD", "section_num": null, "section_title": null, "l1_summary": "You can’t run a product and a services business concurrently.

When\nthat happens, look at what your core value proposition is and see if you\ncan sell it to a different market or in a different way that overcomes\nthose changes---in this case, keeping only a subset of a service and\ndelivering it as an appliance.\n\nLaunching a startup as a consultancy has its risks. It’s easy to get trapped\nin consulting. As the business grows, you’ll want to keep customers happy,\nand won’t have the cycles to dedicate to building the product or service\nyou want. Many startups have lost sight of their initial plan and are now\nconsulting firms---some of them happily. But they don’t meet Paul Graham’s\ntest for scalable, repeatable, rapid growth. They’re not startups.\n\nWhat’s more, in order to make the shift from consultancy to startup, you\nfirst need to test whether your existing customers’ demands are applicable\nto a broader audience. Doing so may violate privacy agreements you have\nwith your customers, so you need to finesse customer development. Your\nexisting clients may feel that a standardized product you plan to offer will\nbe less tailored to their needs; you need to convince them that a standard\nproduct is in fact better for them, because the cost of building future\nversions will be shared among many buyers.\n\nOnce you’ve found the problem you’re going to fix, and have verified that\nthe solution will work with your prospects and clients, you need to segment\nthem. Not all clients are identical, so it’s smart to pick a geographic region,\na particular vertical, or customers who belong to just one of your sales\nteams. That way, you can give those early adopters better attention and\nlimit the impact of failure.\n\nImagine, for example, that you’re building a hiring management tool.

Don’t ignore\nthe companies that made you who you are---but do realize they’re not in a\nmonogamous relationship with you anymore.\n\nZach Nies suggests going even further, segmenting customers into three\ngroups. “‘A customers’ are your really big customers who negotiated a big\ndiscount and expect the world from you. ‘B customers’ are customers who\nare fairly low maintenance, didn’t get a big discount, see themselves as\npartners with you, and provide useful insights. ‘C customers’ cause trouble,\nare a pain to deal with, and demand things from you that you feel will\ndamage your business,” he explains. “Don’t spend too much time on the\nA’s---they sound good but aren’t the best for your business.

In many B2B-focused\ncompanies, the top 20% of customers generate 150--300% of profits, while\nthe middle 70% of customers break even, and the lowest 10% of customers\nreduce 50--200% of profits.*\n\nYou’ll track support metrics like top-requested features, number of\noutstanding trouble tickets, post-sales support, call center hold time, and so\non. This will indicate where you’re losing money, and whether the product\nis standardized and stable enough to move into growth and scaling.\n\nSegment this data, too.

There are entire conferences\ndevoted to the subject, and it’s widely used in new product development for\neverything from laundry detergent to cars. But some of the methodologies\nare instructive. For example, you can get better answers by repeatedly\nasking your customers to compare two possible feature enhancements and\nchoosing the one they can do without, rather than by simply asking them\nto rate the possible features on a scale of 1 to 10. You’ll do even better if\nyou mix up several attributes in each comparison, regardless of whether a\nparticular combination of attributes makes sense.\n\nImagine you’re trying to find a new diet food to introduce. You know the\nattributes that might affect buyers include taste, calories, gluten content,\nand sustainable ingredients. Simply asking prospects whether taste is more\nimportant to them than caloric content is informative. But asking them to\nmake a choice between two discrete offerings---even if those offerings are\ntheoretically impossible---is even better. Would you prefer:\n\n• A delicious, gluten-free, high-calorie candy made with artificial\n\ningredients;\n\n• Or a bland, high-gluten, low-calorie candy of organic origin?\n\nAsking customers to trade off variations of combinations, over and over,\ndramatically improves prediction accuracy. In fact, this is equivalent to\nthe multivariate testing we’ve discussed before, applied to surveys and\ninterviews.\n\nAs you’re designing user events, know what you’re hoping to learn and\ninvest in the conversations and experimental design needed to get real\nanswers that you can turn into the right product roadmap.\n\n*\n\n http://elsa.berkeley.edu/~mcfadden/charterday01/charterday_final.pdf\n\n368\n\nPArt FoUr: PUttIng LeAn AnALYtICS to worK", "source_file": "Lean_Analytics.pdf", "extraction_method": "pdfminer", "ocr_used": false, "has_table": false, "chapter_num": "26", "chapter_title": "USer-generAteD Content: LIneS In tHe SAnD", "section_num": null, "section_title": null, "l1_summary": "The math of choice modeling is complex.

McCallum.* In the 1850s, railroads were a booming business.\nUnfortunately for investors, they didn’t scale well. Small railroads turned a\nprofit; big ones didn’t.\n\nMcCallum noticed this, and divided his railroad into smaller sections,\neach run by subordinates who reported back a standard set of information\nhe defined. McCallum’s line---as well as other lines that copied this\napproach---thrived. McCallum’s model, inspired by his time as a soldier\nand the regimented hierarchies he had learned in the military, was then\napplied to other industries.\n\nMcCallum was the first management scientist, introducing controls,\nstructure, and regulations in order to reduce risk and increase predictability\nat scale. Unfortunately, intrapreneurs aren’t trying to solve for safety and\npredictability. Their job is to take risks, and to uncover the non-obvious and\nthe unpredictable. If you’re trying to provoke change and disrupt the status\nquo, then the organizations McCallum introduced are your kryptonite. You\nneed to shield yourself, just as the engineers within the Skunk Works did\ndecades ago. But you also need to coexist with the organization, because\nunlike an independent startup, the fruits of your labors must integrate with\nyour host company.\n\n• What you make may cannibalize the existing business, or threaten\nemployees’ jobs. People will behave irrationally.

So EMI built its own survey tool. “We\nfound that building our own data set based on asking people questions\nand playing them music was the way to go.” The result was over 1\nmillion detailed interviews, and hundreds of millions of data points.\n\n“Bad data is a pain to sell to people.

If you’re trying to improve\ngrowth rate, you’ll talk to adjacent customers. That’s what Bombardier\ndid when it expanded from snowmobiles to personal watercraft (despite an\ninitial, failed 1960s foray into the industry that was plagued by mechanical\nissues).†\n\nSkip the Business Case, Do the Analytics\n\nAt some point, when it comes time to go beyond interviewing people, you’ll\nneed to build a business case. Traditional product managers build profitand-loss analyses to try to justify their plans: they create a convincing\nbusiness case, and once someone believes it, they get funding to proceed.\nBut a Lean mindset reverses this: you sell the business model---not the\nplan---without a lot of prediction, and then rely heavily on analytics to\ndecide whether to kill the product or double-down on it.\n\nThis analyze-after rather than predict-before model is possible because\nmany of the costs of innovation can be pushed later in the product\ndevelopment cycle. Just-in-time manufacturing, on-demand printing,\nservices that replace upfront investment with pay-by-the-drink capacity,\nCAD/CAM design, and mercenary contractors all mean that you don’t\nhave to invest heavily up front (and therefore don’t have to argue a business\ncase at the outset). Rather, you can ask for a modest budget, build analytics\ninto the product, and launch sooner for less money. You can then use the\ndata and customer feedback you get, which is vanishingly cheap to collect\ngiven today’s technology, to plead your case based on actual evidence.\n\nStickiness: Know your Real Minimum\n\nIf you’ve identified a problem worth solving and a solution that customers\nwill want, it’s time to make an MVP.

Earlier in the book we said that a good metric is one\nthat drives decision making. As a leader within your organization, demand\nproof through data before making decisions.\n\nData doesn’t just lead to better decisions. It also improves organizational\nefficiency. You can create a flatter, more autonomous organization once\neveryone buys in to a data-informed approach, because rather than needing\nto propagate an opinion across the organization, you can let the facts speak\nfor themselves. You can empower employees to make more decisions and\ntake on more responsibility once they’ve got the data in place to support\nthem. Create a culture of accountability, and then reward those who step\nup and deliver.\n\nWhether you’re in a leadership position or not, you can make your\norganization more data-centric. Here’s how.\n\nStart Small, Pick One thing, and Show Value\n\nThere will always be naysayers in an organization who believe instinct, gut,\nand “the way we’ve always done business” are good enough. The best thing\nyou can do is pick a small but significant problem your company faces (take\nany single metric of importance, be it churn, percent daily active users,\nwebsite conversions, etc.) and work to improve it through analytics.\n\nDon’t go after the most crucial issue your company is facing---that’s likely\ngot too many cooks in the kitchen already (or worse, it’s mired in politics\nyou don’t want to wade into). Instead, pick an ancillary issue, something\nthat can add demonstrable business value but is being overlooked.\n\nThis approach, if taken too far, can lead to silos within the company, and\nthat’s a bad thing. Once you’ve demonstrated the benefits with one issue,\nroll out the process across all departments and product areas.\n\nMake Sure goals Are Clearly understood\n\nTo prove the value of an analytics-focused company, any project you take\non needs to have clear goals. If you don’t have a goal in mind (including\na line in the sand that you’ve drawn), you’ll fail.
