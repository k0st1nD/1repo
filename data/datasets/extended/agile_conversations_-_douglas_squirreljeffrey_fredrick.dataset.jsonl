At the heart of the waste, in\nTaylor’s mind, was the wide variation in how work was performed from one\nworker to the next. It would be much better, he reasoned, for everyone to be\ntaught the one right way, and then for workers to follow that way without\ndeviation; any other approach must necessarily be less efficient. And who\ndetermined the one right way? Professional managers and consultants such as\nTaylor himself.\n\n“Scientic management,” the philosophy of which Taylor was the most\nvocal proponent, says that it is the job of managers to devise and understand\nthe best way of working and then enforce unswerving standardization.

Managers\nwere the mechanical engineers, designing how all the pieces should work and\nchecking that they were operating correctly.

Building on top of that, the development\nof human and animal communication seems to have been driven by the need to\nshare information about others of the same species---the need to gossip.\nGossiping allowed us, as social animals, to understand each other and have\nestablished reputations; and this, in turn, allowed us to collaborate in larger\ngroups and to develop more sophisticated collaboration. In fact, understanding\nother humans, developing a “theory of mind,” is so important that philosopher\nDaniel Dennett, in From Bacteria to Bach and Back: e Evolution of Minds,\nmakes the case that our own consciousness arose as a byproduct of\n\nunderstanding the minds of others.2\n\nough our ability to gossip surpasses that of other species, Harari says\nthat what is really unique about human language is our ability to discuss\nnonexistent things.3 With this special power, we are able to create and believe\nshared ctions. ese ctions allow us to collaborate at tremendous scales and\nacross groups of people who have never met.

In the next section, we describe our preferred method for this, the\nTwo-Column Conversational Analysis. It may be tempting to avoid pen and\npaper and just think about the conversation “in your mind’s eye,” or talk about\nit with a friend. Do not do this! e act of writing down the words on paper is an\ninherent part of the process because it forces your brain to think about the\nconversation at arm’s length, as if it were happening to someone else. is\ndistance is vital to gaining insights through reection and revision, as we’ll see\nlater.**\n\nAfter you have Recorded the conversation, it’s time to Reect on it, paying\nattention to the tool or technique you are trying to use at the time. For each of\nthe Five Conversations, we will suggest particular tools. With time and\npractice, you will move between them as the conversation requires, but to start\nwith, we recommend you use one tool or technique at a time. We will give you\nguidelines on how to score your conversation using the tool, and that reection\nwill lead you to possible improvements.\n\nHaving scored the conversation, Revise your conversation to try and\nproduce a better result. How will you know if you’ve improved? Repeat: take\nyour revised dialogue and Reect again. Did you improve your score from the\nrst time around? You may be surprised to nd that your revised version in\nfact shows no better scores than your original! Don’t be discouraged---this is\nvery common, especially as you are learning a new skill. It might take you half a\ndozen or more attempts to produce a revision that checks all the boxes of the\ntechnique.\n\nHaving created the dialogue for an alternative conversation, there’s still an\nimportant step remaining: Role Play. Find a friend who is willing to help, and\ntry saying your dialogue aloud, with your friend taking the part of your\nconversation partner. How does it feel to say the words out loud?

When we review our unshared thoughts, it is also worth remembering another tip from Rosenberg: distinguish evaluations from observations.21 It is\nin our nature to instantly and effortlessly assign an intent to the actions we see\nfrom other people, as when Norbert brands Quinn as a “hypocrite.” ese\nevaluations arise so quickly, it is easy to mistake them for the truth. When we notice these\nattributions of intent, or emotions that haven’t been stated by the other\nperson, they should be a trigger for curiosity---a trigger for us to inquire how\nthe other person is actually thinking and feeling.

Since others, including you, are working on this\ncode happily, you believe there is a misalignment that is affecting trust, as\nHelen’s complaints sap morale and she resists all suggestions for improving\nthe problem code. You are starting to suspect that she and perhaps others\nare going to refuse to update prices until the whole subsystem is rewritten,\nwhich you don’t think the company can afford right now.\n\nRung 1: Observable Data. “Helen, I heard you say in the standup that\nthe pricing code is overengineered. Did I understand you correctly?”\n\n“Yes, anyone can see it’s impenetrable.”\nYou have established the basis for the conversation---that Helen\nsees a complexity problem. Your test is green; move to the next step.\n\nRung 2: Data Selection. “Got it. For me, the important part of any\ncomplex code is its architecture---how it’s divided into chunks---\nbecause that’s hardest to change. Is that the area of most concern\nfor you too?”\n\n“Absolutely. I mean, the comments and variable names suck, but\nwe can refactor to improve those over time. I can’t see how any new\njoiner can hope to understand a forest of tiny classes like we have,\nthough.”\n\nAfter hearing your reasoning, Helen has conrmed agreement.\nGreen again.

In e Challenger Launch\nDecision: Risky Technology, Culture, and Deviance at NASA, Diane Vaughan\ninvestigates the space shuttle explosion in 1986;6 and Richard Feynman, in\nan appendix to the Rogers Commission Report, separately analyzed NASA’s\nresponses to problems observed during launches of the space shuttle on\n\ncold days.7 Both observed what Vaughan called the normalization of\ndeviance: Because the shuttle had launched without calamity over and over\nin cold conditions, NASA concluded that cracks observed in booster\ncomponents on such ights were not a problem. Although no cracks at all\nin the O-rings were expected, the fact that they were small in size led some\nengineers to conclude the danger they posed was low. Others had concerns\n---What reason could there be for believing that the next crack would be as\nsmall as the previous ones?---but did not speak up loudly enough to stop\nthe ights.\n\nIn fact, NASA managers believed so strongly in the safety of shuttle\nlaunches that they decided it was a good idea to put a civilian teacher on\nthe Challenger ight of January 28, 1986. at morning, with icicles\nforming on the launch tower, the boosters exploded exactly as the\nengineers had feared they would, killing the entire crew.\n\ne phenomenon of ickering tests, or tests that randomly fail, in\nsoftware development teams illustrates how normalization of deviance can\naffect a team, though with much less dire consequences.
