It\n\nworks for all types of software delivery and is methodology agnostic. I\n\nhave personally experienced it and have multiple examples of applying\n\nthese practices within mainframe environments, traditional packaged\n\nsoftware application delivery teams, and product teams. It can work across\n\nthe board. It takes discipline, persistence, transformational leadership,\n\nand a focus on people. After all, people are an organization's #1 asset, but\n\nso often that is not how organizations operate. Even though the journey\n\nwill not be easy, I can say that it is denitely worth it, and not only will you\n\nsee better results, your team will be happier.

{"segment_id": "00043", "page_num": 43, "segment": "THE FLAWS IN PREVIOUS ATTEMPTS TO\n\nMEASURE PERFORMANCE\n\nere have been many attempts to measure the performance of software\n\nteams. Most of these measurements focus on productivity. In general, they\n\nsuffer from two drawbacks. First, they focus on outputs rather than\n\noutcomes. Second, they focus on individual or local measures rather than\n\nteam or global ones. Let's take three examples: lines of code, velocity, and\n\nutilization.\n\nMeasuring productivity in terms of lines of code has a long history in\n\nsoftware. Some companies even required developers to record the lines of\ncode committed per week.1 However, in reality we would prefer a 10-line\nsolution to a 1,000-line solution to a problem. Rewarding developers for\n\nwriting lines of code leads to bloated software that incurs higher\n\nmaintenance costs and higher cost of change. Ideally, we should reward\n\ndevelopers for solving business problems with the minimum amount of\n\ncode--and it's even better if we can solve a problem without writing code at\n\nall or by deleting code (perhaps by a business process change). However,\n\nminimizing lines of code isn't an ideal measure either. At the extreme, this\n\ntoo has its drawbacks: accomplishing a task in a single line of code that no\n\none else can understand is less desirable than writing a few lines of code\n\nthat are easily understood and maintained.\n\nWith the advent of Agile software development came a new way to\n\nmeasure productivity: velocity. In many schools of Agile, problems are\n\nbroken down into stories. Stories are then estimated by developers and\n\nassigned a number of \"points\" representing the relative effort expected to\n\ncomplete them. At the end of an iteration, the total number of points\n\nsigned off by the customer is recorded--this is the team's velocity. Velocity", "source_file": "Forsgren N., Humble J., Kim G.- Accelerate.
