But that is not\nnecessarily your fault. You have been taught to collect the wrong metrics,\nimplement the wrong policies, and make the wrong decisions. Together, we\ncan do better.\n\nUp until now you have probably assumed that the reason your process\nis unpredictable is due to circumstances completely outside of your control.\nHowever, you have much more control over the way you work than you\nthink you do. Whether explicit or not, you have put policies in place that\nspecifically prevent you from being predictable. Amongst other things you\nstart new work at a faster rate than you finish old work, you work on too\nmany items at the same time, you ignore systemic dependencies and\nimpediments, and you expedite requests that do not need to be expedited.\nYou, in effect, initiate a denial of service attack on yourself, and then\nwonder why it takes so long for things to get things done.\nBut all of those policies are under your control.\nIf we, as knowledge workers, want to get to a predictable world, we\n\nmust first start by controlling the policies we can control. Taking this\ncontrol will seem uncomfortable at first. It will mean saying no to customer\nrequests to start new work immediately. It will mean placing much less\nemphasis on upfront estimation and planning. It will mean looking at a\ndifferent set of metrics than the ones you have been trained to track. Those\nmetrics will tell you how predictable you are and what actions to take to\nimprove. If you choose to collect the metrics suggested by this book, you\nwill see that the data provided by them will immediately reflect policies you\nhave in place. That data will in turn suggest the changes to your policies\nnecessary to be more predictable. Those policy changes will themselves be\nreflected in the new data you collect after the change. And so on and so on.\n\nYour process is unpredictable. You know it.

{"segment_id": "00007", "page_num": 7, "segment": "Why Write this Book?\nBecause our customers demand predictability. Because you need someone\non your side who has been asked tough questions and has found a way to\ngive meaningful answers. Because most organizations that I visit are either\nuninformed or have been misinformed about what metrics and analytics\nthey need to track to be predictable.\n\nBut to get you where you need to be, I am going to ask you\nprovocative questions. I am going to challenge your assumptions about\nwhat true Agility is. I may make you uncomfortable with some of the\nconclusions that I draw. I hope you will forgive me for all of these as my\nonly intention is to make your process better. After all, as I just said, I am\non your side.\n\nWho Should Read this Book\nAnyone who has ever been asked to give an estimate should read this book.\nLikewise, anyone who has ever asked for an estimate should read this book.\nAnalysts, developers and testers need to know how to stop giving\n\nestimates and how to start making accurate predictions.\n\nProduct owners, project managers, and executives need to know what\n\nmakes for a meaningful prediction and how to hold teams accountable to\nmake those predictions.\n\nConventions Used\nAll metrics and analytics will be capitalized. For example: Work In\nProgress, Cycle Time, Throughput, Cumulative Flow Diagram, Scatterplot,\netc.\n\nI am also going to capitalize all methodology names. For example:\n\nAgile, Scrum, Kanban, etc.\n\nLastly, I am going to use the words “process” and “system”\n\ninterchangeably.

We met one night at an Agile\nPhilly event where I was giving a talk on the principles of flow. He came up\nto me after my presentation and asked if we could set up some time later to\ndiscuss the problems he was facing at HS. Of course I agreed.\n\nWe spoke on the phone the following day and during that call Bennet\n\noutlined his thoughts on all the issues he was facing at HS. Those issues are\nfully documented in the case study presented in Chapter 17 so I will not go\ninto any detail here. Suffice it to say, however, that toward the end of the\ncall, I suggested to Bennet that to fix these problems we must first consider\nwhat is most important to his customers. In other words, if I were to speak\nto his customers, what would they tell me were the three most important\nthings to them?\n\n“Oh, that’s easy,” Bennet replied. “The three most important things to\n\nour customers are predictability, predictability, and predictability.”\n\nPredictability\n“When will it be done?”\n\nThat is the first question your customers ask you once you start work\n\nfor them.

Eric Reis, of Lean Startup\nfame, gives one perspective: “The only metrics that entrepreneurs should\ninvest in are those that help them make decisions.” Well said. Troy\nMagennis, of Lean Forecasting fame, goes even further: “If a metric does\nnot offer predictive power, then capturing that metric is waste.” I discussed\nearlier how the important questions that our customers ask are going to\nrequire us to make predictions. I have further suggested that these flow\nmetrics in and of themselves are the answers to those questions. By\ndefinition, then, tracking these metrics offer predictive power and will help\nus make better decisions.\n\nYet another vital criterion exists that should be considered when\ndetermining what metrics to capture: cost. There is no point in tracking a\nmetric if it is going to bankrupt you to do so. Herein lies yet another\nadvantage of tracking these metrics of flow: these metrics are very\ninexpensive to gather. Any Agile tool should track these metrics (how easy\nit is to mine this data from a given tool and how accurately those tools\ndisplay the analytics is a different story that we will get to in Chapter 16).\nEven if you do not have an Agile tool, these metrics are very easy to\nmanually track using a simple spreadsheet.

They do not exist because, as I discussed earlier,\nmost of those earlier methodologies were not designed from the premise\nthat managing flow is the best strategy for predictability.

The answers will come from the monitoring,\nmeasurement, and management of a specific set of metrics. This chapter is\nall about defining these metrics: Work In Progress (WIP), Cycle Time, and\nThroughput.\n\nThe good news is that these flow metrics are exactly the ones we need\nto track in order to answer the questions that our customers are asking. The\ncustomer question “How long to complete?” is best answered by the flow\nmetric known as Cycle Time. The customer question “How many new\nfeatures am I going to get in the next release?” is a question best answered\nby the flow metric known as Throughput.

To do so, let’s use the metaphor of a simple queuing system. I\nwould argue that all processes can be modelled in the manner depicted in\nFigure 2.1:\n\nFigure 2.1: A Simple Queuing System\n\nIn a queuing system there is work that arrives to a process and there is\n\nwork that departs a process. When making a determination of whether\nsomething counts as in progress or not, the first aspect of system that needs\nto be considered is what does it mean for something to have “arrived”? That\nis to say, your team needs to define a specific point where a unit of work\ntransforms from being just some arbitrary idea into being a legitimate work\nitem that is to immediately be acted on and completed. Before that arrival\npoint, the item is just some candidate for work. After that arrival point, the\nitem is counted as Work In Progress.\n\nIn a pull-based system, an entry (or boundary) point is fairly easy to define. That is\nbecause in a pull system, a team only starts work when it has capacity to do so. Thus, a\nwork item can only count as Work In Progress if it has been voluntarily pulled into the\nprocess by the individual, team, or organization responsible for operating that process.\nThe “arrival point” of the system, therefore, is the point at which the team performs its\nfirst pull transaction on the work. After that first pull transaction, an item is considered\nWIP until it departs the process. (This arrival point is also considered a point of\n“commitment”. An in-depth look at how just-in-time commitment and just-in-time\nprioritization work are topics that I will cover in Chapter 8).\n\nFor push-based systems, an entry point is much harder to define. That is because there is\nno consideration for a team’s capacity when deciding when work should be started. In a\npush system work can be considered started when any stakeholder has a reasonable\nexpectation that work has been committed to (whether the team responsible for\nperforming the work knows about it or agrees to it or not). This expectation could be set\nfor such arbitrary reasons as the work has been requested, the project has been funded, or\nsome manager somewhere thinks it is a good idea to start---regardless of whether there is\nany capacity to do so.\n\nObviously I have a bias for pull systems over push systems, but the concept of WIP\napplies regardless of context.

Getting a handle on what you consider WIP is a\nnecessary (but unfortunately not sufficient) step down the road to predictability.\n\nFor a work item to no longer count as in progress, there must be a\nspecific point of departure from the process. Departure could be defined as\ndelivery to an actual end user or delivery to some other downstream team or\nprocess. For example, if a development team is responsible for its own\ndeployments to production, then that team might consider an item only to\nhave departed once a deployment to production has been made. Or a\ndifferent team who is not responsible for deployments might consider an\nitem to only have departed once it has been reasonably handed off to a\ndownstream operations team who would then handle deployments. Again,\nthe definition of a point of departure holds true whether you are operating a\npull or a push system.\n\nTo sum up, for in progress definition purposes your team must a\nspecific point when it considers work to have arrived to the process and it\nmust define a specific point where work has departed the process.

As I mentioned in the\nintroduction, you need to abandon that type of thinking if you truly want to\nbuild predictable processes.\n\nFor those of you who do not want to wait, an explanation of why size\n\ndoes not matter (said the actress to the bishop) will be given in Chapter 3\n(the chapter on Little’s Law). For now, all you need to know is that WIP is\ncalculated by counting individual work items.\n\nNor is there any restriction on the level at which you track work items.\nYou can track WIP at the portfolio, project, feature, epic, or story level---just\nto name a few. All of these types of decisions will be completely up to you.\nFor you Kanban practitioners out there, you will also want to note that\nthere is a difference between WIP and WIP limits. You cannot calculate WIP\nsimply by adding up all the WIP limits on your board. It should work that\nway, but it does not. This result should be obvious as most Kanban boards do\nnot always have columns that are at their full WIP limit. A more common\nsituation is to have a Kanban board with WIP limit violations in multiple\ncolumns. In either of those cases simply adding up WIP limits will not give\nyou an accurate WIP calculation.

Defining Cycle Time in terms of WIP removes much---if not all---\nof the arbitrariness of some of the other explanations of Cycle Time that you\nmay have seen (and been confused by) and gives us a tighter definition to\nstart measuring this metric. The moral of this story is: you essentially have\ncontrol over when something is counted as Work In Progress in your\nprocess. Take some time to define those policies around what it means for an\nitem to be “Work In Progress” in your system and start and stop your Cycle\nTime clock accordingly.\n\nNot only does defining Cycle Time in terms of Work In Progress make\nit more concrete and easier for people to understand, but it also brings some\nneeded consistency when talking about Cycle Time with respect to Little’s\nLaw (Chapter 3) and with respect to how Cycle Time is (or is not!)\nvisualized on a Cumulative Flow Diagram (Chapter 5).\n\nLastly, notice the emphasis on “elapsed time”.

My\nguess would be that your customer’s expectation would be that they would\nget their item on or before March 31. However, if you meant 30 “business\ndays” then your expectation is the customer would get something sometime\naround the middle of April. I am sure you can see where that difference in\nexpectations might be a problem.\n\nSecond, if you only measure active time, you are ignoring a large part\nof your predictability problem. It is the time that an item spends waiting or\ndelayed (i.e., not actively being worked) that is usually where most of your\nunpredictability lies.

{"segment_id": "00026", "page_num": 26, "segment": "Lead Time vs. Cycle Time\n\nIf you have been exposed to Lean or Kanban concepts before reading this book, then\nwhat I have just defined as Cycle Time may sound a lot like what you have come to\nrecognize as Lead Time. I understand that most people in the Kanban community prefer\nthe term Lead Time to Cycle Time, but I am not one of them. My intention here is not to\ndive headlong into an academic (and ultimately useless) debate about which\nnomenclature is better, but I feel that I should at least present my thoughts on why I have\nchosen the terms that I have. You may agree or disagree with my reasoning, but I hope\nyou understand my intention here is not to be provocative or antagonistic (yet). I am\ngoing to talk about nomenclature in general a little later, but these specific terms require\nsome special attention.\n\nSo why choose the term Cycle Time over Lead Time? My first argument is that regardless\nof whether you are talking about Cycle Time or Lead Time, you still have to qualify the\nboundaries of your time calculation. That is do say, both terms are very dependent on\none’s perspective: one person’s Lead Time is another person’s Cycle Time and vice versa.\nFor example, the development team’s Lead Time is just the Product Manager’s Cycle\nTime through the development phase. While it is true that Lead Time gives more of a\nsense of an end-to-end calculation, what “end-to-end” means must still be defined for any\ngiven context. Given that in both cases boundaries must be qualified, I see no clear\nadvantage of the term Lead Time over the term Cycle Time. Further, defining Cycle Time\nin terms of when something is counted as WIP clears up a lot of this ambiguity.\n\nSecondly, I do not buy the argument that we, the Lean-Agile community, should shy\naway from using the term Cycle Time because the manufacturing industry has already\ndefined it in a different way that may or may not be in agreement with how we use the\nname. I do not subscribe to the thinking that the “Lean” we are talking about here is just\nmanufacturing theory wholly and blindly applied to knowledge work. I fully reject this\nthesis. The fact that manufacturing has its own definition of Cycle Time should be neither\ninfluential nor consequential to how we in knowledge work choose to define the term.\n\nLastly, and, I must stress, most importantly, the authors that I quote most---Reinertsen\nand Little---both favor the use of the term Cycle Time. If it is good enough for them, then\nit is good enough for me.\n\nBy the way, Hopp and Spearman also sometimes refer to Cycle Time as “Flow Time”. I\nwould suggest that the term “Flow Time” might be a better way for us to communicate\nwhat we really mean by Cycle Time in our context anyway. Even so, for the rest of the\nbook, I will use the more common term, Cycle Time, and I will use it in the way that I\nhave defined it here.\n\nAs I will show you in the chapter on Forecasting (Chapter 14), Cycle\nTime is going to be one of the main metrics you will need to come up with\nan accurate forecast for a project’s (or story’s or feature’s) completion.

{"segment_id": "00027", "page_num": 27, "segment": "The first supporting reason is that Cycle Time can be a rather good\npredictor of cost. Very generally speaking, the longer something takes to\ncomplete the more it is going to cost. Project, feature, or even user story cost\ncan be one of the biggest determiners of whether a company chooses to\ninvest in development or not. Like it or not, we are going to need Cycle\nTime data to figure out development cost.\n\nThere is still a more important reason to understand Cycle Time. Cycle\n\nTime represents the amount of time it takes to get customer feedback.\nCustomer feedback is of vital importance in our knowledge work world.\nValue itself is ultimately determined by the customer, which means your\nteam is going to want to make sure it gets that value feedback as quickly as\npossible. The last thing you want is to develop something that the customer\ndoes not need---especially if it takes you forever to do so. Shortening Cycle\nTime will shorten the customer feedback loop. And to shorten Cycle Time,\nyou are going to first need to measure it.\n\nA final reason to monitor Cycle Time is that it can give you an overall\n\npicture of your process’s health. The diagnostic tool needed for that is\nsomething called Flow Efficiency. Simply put, Flow Efficiency is the ratio of\nthe total elapsed time that an item was actively worked on to the total\nelapsed time that it took for an item to complete (its total Cycle Time).\nThere’s a subtlety in this definition that bears some explanation. As an item\nis flowing through a process it is in either one of two states. It is either being\nactively worked on or it is not being actively worked on. Examples of an\nitem not being actively worked on is it is blocked by some external\ndependency (team, vendor, etc.), or it is queuing waiting to be pulled. In\nboth of those examples, an item is accumulating Cycle Time but no one is\nactively working on it. To get Flow Efficiency, you take the Total Cycle\nTime, subtract out inactive time and then divide that result by the Total\nCycle Time.\n\nIt is not uncommon for teams just starting out with managing for flow\n\nto have Flow Efficiencies in the 15% range. Think about that for a second. If\na user story took 20 days to complete and had a Flow Efficiency of 15% that\nmeans that it spent only 3 days having someone actively work on it and it\nspent 17 days in some type of inactive state. If a user story took only 3 active\ndays of work yet had 17 days of inactivity built into its Cycle Time, where\ndo you think you should focus your process improvement activities?

Simply put, Throughput is\ndefined as:\n\nThroughput: the amount of WIP (number of work items) completed per unit of time.\n\nStated a slightly different way, Throughput is a measure of how fast\nitems depart a process. The unit of time that your team chooses for your\nThroughput measurement is completely up to you. Your team can choose to\nmeasure the number of items that it gets done per day, per week, per\niteration, etc. For example, you might state that the Throughput of your\nsystem as “three stories per day” (for a given day) or “five features per\nmonth” (for a given month).\n\nA further thing to know about Throughput, however, is that this metric\n\nas I have defined it here is very different from the Scrum metric of\n“Velocity”. Velocity, as you may know, is measured in terms of Story Points\nper sprint or iteration.

As I have just mentioned, the\nunit of time you choose for Throughput is completely up to you. The\nimplication being that your choice of a time period need not necessarily\ncoincide with an iteration boundary. I say all of this because many agile\ncoaches and consultants use the words “Velocity” and “Throughput”\ninterchangeably. Just know that these two terms are definitely not\nsynonymous.\n\nIf Throughput is how fast items depart from a process, then Arrival\n\nRate is how fast items arrive to a process.

In fact, one of the best definitions of such a queuing system comes\nfrom Dr. Little himself: “A queuing system consists of discrete objects we\nshall call items, which arrive at some rate to the system. The items could be\ncars at a toll booth, people in a cafeteria line, aircraft on a production line,\nor instructions waiting to be executed inside a computer. The stream of\narrivals enters the system, joins one or more queues and eventually receives\nservice, and exits in a stream of departures. The service might be a taxi ride\n(travelers), a bowl of soup (lunch eaters), or auto repair (car owners). In\nmost cases, service is the bottleneck that creates the queue, and so we\nusually have a service operation with a service time, but this is not required.\nIn such a case we assume there is nevertheless a waiting time. Sometimes a\ndistinction is made between number in queue and total number in queue\nplus service, the latter being called number in system.” The diversity of\ndomains that he mentions here is extraordinary. While he does not\nspecifically mention software development or knowledge work in general, I\nam going to suggest that these areas can also be readily modeled in this\nway.\n\nIn 1961, Dr. Little set out to prove what seemed to be a very general\nand very common result exhibited by all queuing systems. The result that he\nwas researching was a connection between the average Arrival Rate of a\nqueue, the average number of items in the queue, and the average amount of\ntime an item spent in the queue (for the purpose of this chapter, when I say\n“average” I am really talking about “arithmetic mean”).

This point is going to be of special interest a little\nlater in this chapter.\n\nAlso notice that---if it is not obvious already---Little’s Law is a\n\nrelationship of averages. Most knowledge work applications and\ndiscussions of the law neglect this very important detail. The fact that\nLittle’s Law is based on averages is not necessarily good or bad. It is only\nbad when people to try to apply the law for uses that it was never intended.\nDr. Little was the first to provide a rigorous proof for Equation (1) and,\n\nas such, this relationship has since been known as Little’s Law. According\nto him, one of the reasons why the law is so important is the fact that\n(emphasis is mine): “L, λ, and W are three quite different and important\nmeasures of effectiveness of system performance, and Little’s Law insists\nthat they must obey the ‘law.’... Little’s Law locks the three measures\ntogether in a unique and consistent way for any system in which it applies.\nLittle’s Law will not tell the managers how to handle trade-offs or provide\ninnovations to improve their chosen measures, but it lays down a necessary\nrelation. As such, it provides structure for thinking about any operation that\ncan be cast as a queue and suggests what data might be valuable to collect.”\nThe great advantage of Little’s Law is the overall simplicity of its\n\ncalculation. Specifically, if one has any two of the above three statistics,\nthen one can easily calculate the third. This result is extremely useful as\nthere are many situations in many different domains where the\nmeasurement of all three metrics of interest is difficult, expensive, or even\nimpossible. Little’s Law shows us that if we can measure any two attributes,\nthen we automatically get the third.\n\nTo illustrate this point, Dr. Little used the very simple example of a\nwine rack. Let’s say you have a wine rack that, on average, always has 100\nbottles in it. Let’s further say that you replenish the rack at an average rate\nof two bottles per week. Knowing just these two numbers (and nothing\nelse!) allows us to determine how long, on average, a given bottle spends\nsitting in the rack. By applying Equation (1), we have L equal to 100 and λ\nequal to 2.

This tactic has a particular significance when it comes to process\npredictability (spoiler alert: it is usually bad) which is why I have devoted a\nwhole chapter (Chapter 13) to Class of Service later.\n\nKanban Systems\nFrom a WIP perspective, it may seem that running a Kanban system\nguarantees Little’s Law’s assumptions are taken care of. There are several\nreasons why that may not be the case:\n\n1. It is possible that changing WIP limits may have no effect on total\n\naverage WIP (e.g., decreasing or increasing a WIP limit after a clear\nsystemic bottleneck). This may be one reason you do not get the\n“forecasted” behavior you might expect from Little’s Law.\n\n2. Setting a WIP limit is not necessarily the same as limiting Work In\n\nProgress. I cannot tell you how many teams I come across that set WIP\nLimits but then routinely violate them. And violate them egregiously.\n3. Average WIP over a time period is highly dependent on pull policies in\nplace. E.g., are as many items as possible pulled in order to satisfy\nWIP limits at all times?\n\nThe point here is that if you are using a Kanban system, you cannot\njust simply add up all the WIP Limits on your board and think that you have\ncalculated WIP for your process (as discussed previously in Chapter 2). You\nare going to have actually track physical WIP.

While I would not strictly\ndisagree with that statement, I would offer a better way of stating it. I would\nsay that Little’s Law is the single greatest reason to move to a more WIPlimited, pull-based, continuous flow process. The thing is, once we do that,\nwe can then start to use Little’s Law as our guide for process predictability.\n\nSize Does Not Matter\nI have one last topic I want to cover before wrapping up. Notice how in the\nassumptions for Little’s Law I made no mention a requirement for all work\nitems to be of the same size. That is because no such requirement exists.\nMost people assume that an application of Little’s Law specifically---and\nlimiting WIP in general---necessitates that all work items be of the same\nsize. That is simply not true. The precise reasons why would fill up a\nchapter in its own right, so I am going to limit my comments to two brief\npoints.\n\nFirst, work items size does not matter because for Little’s Law we are\n\ndealing with relationships among averages. We do not necessarily care\nabout each item individually, we care about what all items look like on\naverage.\n\nSecond, and more importantly, the variability in work item size is\nprobably not the variability that is killing your predictability. Your bigger\npredictability problems are usually too much WIP, the frequency with\nwhich you violate Little’s Law’s assumptions, etc. Generally those are\neasier problems to fix than trying to arbitrarily make all work items the\nsame size. Even if you were in a context where size did matter, it would be\nmore about right-sizing your work and not same-sizing your work (but\nmore on that in Chapter 12).\n\nForecasting\nAs this is a book about predictability, my guess is that you were expecting\nme to say that once you understand Little’s Law all you need to do is to\nplug in the numbers and out will pop the forecasting result that you are\nlooking for (à la Newton’s F = ma or Einstein’s E=mc2).

It\nis not about looking forward; that is, is not meant to be used to make\ndeterministic predictions. As Dr. Little himself says about the law, “This is\nnot all bad. It just says that we are in the measurement business, not the\nforecasting business”.\n\nThis point requires a little more discussion as it is usually where\npeople get hung up. The “law” part of Little’s Law specifies an exact\nrelationship between average WIP, average Cycle Time, and average\nThroughput, and this “law” part only applies only when you are looking\nback over historical data. The law is not about---and was never designed for\n---making deterministic forecasts about the future. For example, let’s\nassume a team that historically has had an average WIP of 20 work items,\nan average Cycle Time of 5 days, and an average Throughput of 4 items per\nday. You cannot say that you are going to increase average WIP to 40, keep\naverage Cycle Time constant at 5 days and magically Throughput will\nincrease to 8 items per day---even if you add staff to the keep the WIP to\nstaff ratio the same in the two instances. You cannot assume that Little’s\nLaw will make that prediction. It will not. All Little’s Law will say is that\nan increase in average WIP will result in a change to one or both of average\nCycle Time and average Throughput. It will further say that those changes\nwill manifest themselves in ways such that the relationship among all three\nmetrics will still obey that law. But what it does not say is that you can\ndeterministically predict what those changes will be. You have to wait until\nthe end of the time interval you are interested in and look back to apply the\nlaw.\n\nBut that restriction is not fatal. The proper application of Little’s Law\n\nin our world is to understand the assumptions of the law and to develop\nprocess policies that match those assumptions. If the process we operate\nconforms---or mostly conforms---to all of the assumptions of the law then\nwe get to a world where we can start to trust the data that we are collecting\noff of our system. It is at this point that our process is probabilistically\npredictable. Once there we can start to use something like Monte Carlo\nsimulation on our historical data to make forecasts and, more importantly,\nwe can have some confidence in the results we get by using that method.\n\nThere are other, more fundamental reasons why you do not want to use\n\nLittle’s Law to make forecasts.

There are all kinds of reasons\nwhy you should not forecast based on averages---too many to go into here.\nIt turns out we can do better than averages, anyway, when collecting metrics\ndata and there are going to be much better tools at our disposal when we are\nready to do forecasting. Luckily for you, I will discuss some of those tools\nin Chapter 14 and Chapter 15 (I have just mentioned one of them in the\nprevious paragraph).\n\nHaving said all that, though, there is no reason why you cannot use the\n\nlaw for quick, back-of-the-envelope type estimations about the future.

You can choose to label every\ntwo weeks, every month, every day, etc.\n\nA very important point here is that these labels can be very different\nthan the reporting interval that you choose to build your CFD. The reporting\ninterval is the frequency that you choose to add data to your chart. Just as\nwith the labels, your reporting interval is up to you. You can choose to report\non your process data every day, every week, every month, etc. Just note that\nwhatever reporting interval that you choose will change the shape of your\ndiagram (choosing a different reporting interval may certainly be the tweak\nyou want to make in order to get a clearer picture of what’s going on in the\nCFD). Further note that the reporting interval and the labels need not be of\nthe same frequency.

To start, most people will tell you that to create a CFD, all you\nneed to do is physically count all work items in progress at each step of your\nprocess and then just plot those counts on your chart at regular reporting\nintervals. I call this approach “building a chart based on counts”. Not to put\ntoo fine a point on it, but building a chart just by counting items in progress\nis, in a word, dubious.\n\nTo explain why, I would like to explore an example that might illustrate\nthe point better. For this example, I am going to use the same metaphor that\nDr. Little himself has used in several of his publications.\n\nSuppose that the system we wish to model is that of a supermarket. This\n\nparticular shop may have set hours that it opens and closes each day, or it\nmay be---as is the case with more and more American shops---open twentyfour hours a day and seven days a week. At various times throughout its\nhours of operation, it will have customers who enter and leave the shop.\nSome customers will make purchases while others will leave empty-handed.\nHaving this image in mind, let’s explore two very important facts about\n\nour shop example:\n\n1. Given its physical structure, it is very obvious to determine when\n\ncustomers have entered the shop and when customers have left the\nshop. Another way of saying this is that our shop has a very clear point\nat which customers are said to have arrived to the shop, and there is a\nvery clear point at which customers are said to have departed the shop.\n2.

Well, as I have just stated, a CFD is all about arrivals and departures,\nso the first thing we need to ask ourselves: how do we determine if someone\nhas arrived or departed our shop? One of the reasons I chose this particular\nexample is because answering that question in this scenario is actually very\neasy. An arriving customer is anyone who enters the shop from the outside,\nand a departing customer is anyone who leaves the shop from the inside. To\ncalculate these arrivals and departures, we could easily install turnstiles at all\ndoors and count the number of people who enter and exit over time. These\nturnstiles would not track how long each individual spent in the shop, nor\nwould they be able to tell us if a departing individual made a purchase or\nnot. They would, however, increment an arrival count for each customer who\nentered the shop (went from the outside in) and increment a departure’s\ncount for each customer who exited (went from the inside out). Every hour\nwe could go and read those counts off the turnstiles and plot them our graph.\nIf we were tracking those counts in a spreadsheet, the data might look like\nFigure 4.7:\n\nFigure 4.7: Cumulative Count of Arrivals and Departures for the Shop Example\n\nIf using a spreadsheet, this data could easily be converted into an Area\nChart.

I always advise the addition of one “time\nunit” (in this case that time unit is days) because I would argue the shortest\namount of time that an item can take to complete is one unit. For example,\nif a given work item starts and completes on the same day (e.g., September\n1), what is its Cycle Time? If we were just to subtract September 1 from\nSeptember 1 we would get a Cycle Time of zero days. I think that result is\nmisleading. After all, zero days suggests that no time whatsoever was spent\ncompleting that item. That is not reflective of reality which is why one day\nneeds to be added. Further, the addition of one day makes the calculation\nmore inclusive. For example, if a work item starts on September 1 and\nfinishes on September 2, what is its Cycle Time? If all we did is subtract\nthose two dates, we would get a Cycle Time of one day. But I would\nsuggest that since time was spent on that item on both September 1 and\nSeptember 2 that the more representative Cycle Time is two days. Which\nmeans that we would again need to add one day to our calculation. You\nmight disagree with this advice for your own particular situation. And that\nis ok (as long as you are consistent in your calculations). You will just want\nto note, though, that all Cycle Time calculations in this book follow the\n“addition of one time unit” rule.\n\nGetting back to our original discussion, the fact that you can draw a\n\nhorizontal line on a CFD and subtract two dates to come up with an\nApproximate Average Cycle time should be amazing to you for a couple of\nreasons. The first is that to normally calculate an average you simply add up\na whole bunch of values and then divide by the total number of values that\nyou have added up. However, in this case all we are doing is subtracting\ntwo dates to come up with an average. Seems strange that that would work,\nbut it does.\n\nThe second reason that this result is remarkable, is that the items that\n\nstarted in the Analysis Active column (the first column on the board) are not\nnecessarily the stories that have finished in the Done column (the last\ncolumn on the board), yet this calculation will still yield an Approximate\nAverage Cycle Time.

All of these activities are\nperfectly ok and I would challenge you to think about what data attributes\nyou might want to collect and then filter on when analyzing your CFDs.\n\nCFDs offer a concise way to simultaneously visualize the three basic\n\nmetrics of flow: WIP, Cycle Time, and Throughput (albeit sometimes in the\nform of averages or approximate averages). You can only be guaranteed to\ncalculate these metrics, however, if your graph obeys all six properties of a\nCFD:\n\nCFD Property #1 is that the top line of a Cumulative Flow Diagram always represents\nthe cumulative arrivals to a process. The bottom line on a CFD always represents the\ncumulative departures from a process.\n\nCFD Property #2 is that due to its cumulative nature, no line on a CFD can ever\ndecrease (go down).\n\nCFD Property #3 is that the vertical distance between any two lines on a CFD is the\ntotal amount of work that is in progress between the two workflow steps represented by\nthe two chosen lines.\n\nCFD Property #4 is that the horizontal distance between any two lines on a CFD\nrepresents the Approximate Average Cycle Time for items that finished between the two\nworkflow steps represented by the chosen two lines.\n\nCFD Property #5 is that the data displayed on a CFD depicts only what has happened\nfor a given process. Any chart that shows any type of projection is not a CFD.\n\nCFD Property #6 is that the slope of any line between any two reporting intervals on a\nCFD represents the exact Average Arrival Rate of the process state represented by the\nsucceeding band.\n\nWith a strong quantitative understanding of CFDs, we move now to a\nmore qualitative analysis---which is really where the predictability rubber\nhits the road.", "source_file": "Actionable_Agile_Metrics_for_Predictability_An_Introduction_-_Daniel_S_Vacanti.pdf", "extraction_method": "pdfminer", "ocr_used": false, "has_table": false, "chapter_num": "5", "chapter_title": "Flow Metrics and CFDs", "section_num": null, "section_title": null, "l1_summary": "construct a CFD based on only one or more of the subtypes.

What I have given you here are\nsome of the more common things you will come across. I am hoping you\nwill use these examples along with your quantitative analysis knowledge to\ndiscover the right questions to ask sooner. Remember that the point of CFD\nanalysis is not just about looking at a pretty picture. The point is to look at\nthe graph in the context in which it was generated and have a discussion\nabout what the patterns mean to overall process performance and\npredictability. Thus, the real purpose for analyzing a CFD is to learn. You\nlearn by asking questions. “What’s going on with our flow?” “Is it a good\nthing or bad thing?” “If good, how can we keep doing it?” “If bad, what\ninterventions can we take to make things better?” A CFD not only gets you\nasking the right questions sooner, but will also suggest the right actions to\ntake for increased predictability.\n\nI started my discussion of CFDs by saying that not only is most of the\n\ninformation out there in the Agile-o-sphere incorrect concerning these\ncharts, but also that all tools that I have come across (at the time of this\nwriting) generate these graphs incorrectly (save the one which I will discuss\nin a minute). So what are you to do?\n\nOne option is to capture the data manually as I have outlined here and\ngenerate the chart yourself using something like Excel. This is a reasonable\napproach and one that many teams utilize. The problem with Excel is it is\nnot a very dynamic or interactive way to analyze the data. It also becomes\ncumbersome as your dataset gets very large.\n\nThe second option is to use the ActionableAgileTM Analytics tool.

This is one of the reasons\nwhy---as I stated in Chapter 5---that this Ready column would be displayed\non a CFD while the backlog would not.\n\nWe implicitly stated a couple of policies here, so let’s make those\npolicies explicit. First, we have said that work items are only considered to\nhave arrived into our system once they are placed onto our “arrivals” column\n(the “Ready” column in Figure 7.1). Second, this arrivals column will have a\nWIP limit on it and that we will only pull new work into the system when\nthat WIP limit signals that we have capacity to do so. And third, since work\ncan only arrive via this first column, the downstream steps of our process\ncan only consider pulling work from there.\n\nSince what we are ultimately looking for is an understanding of the rate\n\nof arrivals into the system, then measuring that rate now simply becomes a\nmatter of counting the number of new work items placed onto that arrivals\ncolumn per unit time. The unit or interval of time you choose is completely\nup to you (day, week, every two weeks), but one thing you must keep in\nmind is that the unit of time you choose to measure the Arrival Rate must\nmatch the unit of time that you choose to measure your Departure Rate (I\nwill discuss Departure Rate shortly). Thus, if you measure Arrival Rate in\nweeks, then you should also measure the Departure Rate in weeks.\n\nA very subtle but very important point to note here is that choosing the\nsame interval of time to measure arrivals and departures does not mean that\nthe cadence of arrivals and departures must be the same. For example, your\nteam could choose to deploy to production at a cadence of every two weeks,\nbut could also choose to replenish the input column every week. Not only is\nstaggering cadences like that perfectly acceptable, it might be optimal given\nyour specific context. However, it makes comparing Arrival Rates and\nDeparture Rates slightly more complicated. If your Throughput data is in\nterms of two week intervals and your arrival data is in terms of one week\nintervals, then you will have to do some conversion to get them to the same\nunit of time.

The point I am making here is that it does not really matter\nhow you limit WIP throughout the whole system just as long as you do.\n\nIt should be said, though, that even in this particular situation a team\ncould benefit from an arrivals column for many of reasons. Just know that an\nexplicit arrivals column is neither prescribed nor required for predictable\nprocess design.\n\nConclusion\nWhen you have a picture that looks like Figure 7.5 then your process is, by\ndefinition, unpredictable. The direct consequence of an Arrival Rate that\nexceeds a Departure Rate is a steady---if not dramatic---increase in WIP.\nLittle’s Law tells us that an increase in WIP will be matched by an increase\nin Cycle Time. The implication here is that if WIP grows unbounded, then\nCycle Time will also essentially grow unbounded. If your Cycle Time is\never-increasing, then it becomes impossible to answer the question, “how\nlong before this work item will done?”\n\nIn this chapter, I have purposefully not made any mention of how teams\n\nchoose what particular items go on to the arrivals column at replenishment\ntime. Nor have I made any mention of the order in which items should be\npulled through the system once they have been placed on that column. These\nare very important questions and deserve ample consideration. The reason I\nhave left those questions unanswered---for now---is that this chapter is\nsimply about the mechanics of the first necessary step you need to take in\norder to stabilize your system and thus have any hope of predictability.\nLittle’s Law assumption #1 states that the average Arrival Rate to a system\nmust equal the average Departure Rate of the system. I have shown you how\nto do that here. The answers to the replenishment and pull order questions\nwill be addressed in the coming chapters.\n\nI would argue that the arrivals column is one of---if not the most---\nimportant columns for your process design. In this chapter we have explored\ntwo very important reasons why this might be so:\n\n1. The arrivals column acts as the throttle by which we constrain the\n\namount of work that can arrive to our system at any given time.

Many of you will recognize this as the\nlanguage of “Service Level Agreements” or SLAs in Kanban. More on just\nwhat exactly SLAs are and how to set them for your process can be found in\nChapter 12.\n\nNot to get too off-topic here, but I hope this dispels another common\n\nmyth I hear about flow-based systems, and in particular, Kanban. I often\nhear, “Kanban cannot work because there are no commitments”. Nothing\ncould be further from the truth. It is just that the approach to commitments is\nvery different than, say, Scrum. Scrum commitments are made at the sprint\nlevel. At the beginning of a sprint, a team commits to getting some number\nof stories finished by the end of the sprint. That commitment is based more\non upfront estimation and planning. In a flow-based approach, teams commit\nat the individual work item level. Once an item is pulled into the process a\ncommitment is made as to when that item should be done. That commitment\nis based more on measurement and observation rather than planning and\nestimation. The point here is not to denigrate Scrum, but to get you to think\nabout---especially if you are using a method like Scrum---how you might\nincorporate more flow-based principles into your current process.\n\nExceptions to Conservation of Flow\nAs with all of these “rules”, there are always exceptions. There might be---\nand probably are---perfectly good reasons to discard work that is only\npartially completed. Maybe we have gained some knowledge that makes\ncontinuing to work on these particular items unnecessary, duplicative, or\notherwise wasteful. Well, obviously, in those circumstances it makes perfect\nsense to abandon that work. When this happens, though, we should\nchallenge ourselves with the following questions: “Why did that happen?”\n“Was there something that we could have done further upstream in our\nprocess to help avoid this situation?”\n\nBut, potentially more importantly, when these exceptions occur it is\nabsolutely necessary to account for them properly in your data.

Let’s\n\nfurther say that we start some work item and get it all the way to the\n“Development” column before we decide we do not need this particular\nfunctionality.

One very\nimportant consequence of working in the knowledge work domain is that\nyou pretty much have to forget any statistics training that you may have had\nup until this point (for a great book on why we need to forget the statistics\nthat we have been taught read “The Flaw of Averages”).

As such, we can place percentile\nlines on them in much the same way that was explained in Chapter 10.\nFigure 10a.1 shows an example of this.\n\nHaving both views with the same percentiles is useful because both\nviews serve different purposes.

Recall that in one of the chapters on the Conservation of\nFlow (Chapter 8) I talked about the principle of just-in-time commitment.\nJust-in-time commitment helps us to balance the demand on the system with\nthe system’s capacity. However, there is a direct consequence of\nimplementing this methodology. The other dimension of deferred\ncommitment that does not really get talked about all that much is the\nnecessity that we must---at the time of commitment---also communicate to\nour customers a date range and confidence level for each and every\ncommitted-to work item. For example, when we pull an item into our\nprocess we might tell our customers that we expect that item to flow all the\nway through to completion in fourteen days or less with 85% confidence\nlevel.\n\nThese date ranges and confidence levels are normally published as part\n\nof process visualization and are commonly known as “Service Level\nAgreements” or SLAs.

But I can tell you it is probably less than\nyou think. As few as maybe 11 or 12. Probably no more than 30. The bigger\nquestion is in terms of quality not quantity. Instead of considering the\nnumber of dots, one question you may ask yourself is how well is your\nprocess obeying the assumptions of Little’s Law in the producing those\nCycle Times?

Listen to them.\n\nSLAs for Different Work Item Types\nIn the chapter on Cumulative Flow Diagrams (Chapter 4), I talked about the\nstrategy of filtering on different work item types to generate different views\nof your data. The same approach is available for us to use on Cycle Time\nScatterplots. Let’s say we had a dataset that included the work item types of\nuser stories, defects, and maintenance requests. With this data we could\ngenerate a Scatterplot and corresponding percentile lines for the data that\nincluded all three work items. Or we could generate a Scatterplot that\nincluded data for just the user stories. Or one that included just the defects,\nor one for just the maintenance requests, or for some combination thereof.\nAs with CFDs, any one of these data segmentations---and their\ncorresponding analysis---is perfectly valid.\n\nBut why might we want to segment our data in this way? There are at\nleast two answers to this question. The first might be that you have tagged\nthe items that did not finish “normally” (e.g., were abandoned) and want to\nfilter your data to show only those. Displaying only the abandoned items\nwould give you a good visualization as to the time wasted on those activities.\nThat might give rise to questions and conversations about how to minimize\nthose occurrences.\n\nThe second reason for segmenting is that the Cycle Time percentiles for\n\na Scatterplot consisting of data for only the work item type of “story” are\nprobably going to be much different from the Cycle Time percentiles for a\nScatterplot consisting of data for only the work item type of “defect”.\nSegmenting our data this way would allow us---if we wanted---to offer\ndifferent SLAs for different work item types. For example, our SLA for user\nstories might be 14 days at 85% but for defects it might be five days at 85%.\nI am reluctant to discuss this SLA segmentation now, because you have\n\nto be very careful here.

If you are just starting out with flow principles, I would\nhighly recommend just setting one global SLA for all your work items types\nand get predictable that way first. Ignore “conventional wisdom” that you\nhave to design in things like Classes of Service up front and offer different\nSLAs for those different Classes of Service immediately. To put it delicately,\nI believe this type of advice is misguided (a fuller treatment of Class of\nService and its dangers is presented in Chapter 13). If you are new to these\nmetrics, begin by applying the principles presented in this book and then\nmeasure and observe. Get predictable at an overall system level first. You\nmay find that is good enough. Only optimize for subtypes later if you really\nneed to.\n\nRight-Sizing\nOne last thing about percentiles and SLAs. Remember that in Chapter 8 I\ntalked about the concept of just-in-time commitment and about how\noperating a pull system allows us to defer commitment to the last responsible\nmoment. In that chapter I also talked about the consequence of deferring\ncommitment is that we need to do what we can to make sure that---once\ncommitted to---an item has the best possible chance of flowing through the\nsystem to completing. One of those things we need to do is to perform a\n“right size” check on the item.\n\nBefore you ask, right-sizing does not mean you do a lot of upfront\nestimation and planning. Remember, this book emphasizes measurement and\nobservation over estimation and planning. The SLA we have chosen is the\nmeasurement we are looking for. In other words, the SLA will act as the\nlitmus test for whether an item is of the right size to flow through the system.\nFor example, let’s say we have chosen an SLA of fourteen days at 85%.\nBefore a team pulls an item into the process, a quick question should be\nasked if the team believes that this particular item can be finished in fourteen\ndays or less. The length of this conversation should be measured in seconds.\nSeriously, seconds. Remember, at this point we do not care if we think this\nitem is going to take exactly five days or nine days or 8.247 days.

This\nproof usually takes the form of a valid boarding pass and a valid\ngovernment-issued ID.\n\nThe United States is no exception to this rule. In the U.S., the\nTransportation Security Administration (TSA) is responsible performing\npassenger checks. TSA agents are stationed right before security and\npassengers wishing to get to the departures area must first check-in with\nthese agents.\n\nMany small airports in the U.S. staff only one TSA agent to perform\n\ntraveler validation. At those small airports during busy periods, quite a long\nqueue will form in front of the sole agent. Little’s Law tells us that as more\nand more people join the queue, those people can expect to wait for longer\nand longer amounts of time to get through the checkpoint (on average). In\nthis scenario, if you are a regular passenger, do you see the problem with\npredictability?\n\nIt gets worse.\nIn an attempt to streamline the process for what are considered low-risk\n\npassengers, the TSA has introduced something called “TSA Pre-check”\n(TSA Pre). Passengers who are certified as TSA Pre do not have to go\nthrough the whole security rigmarole of taking off shoes, taking off belts,\ntaking off jackets, and removing laptops. That is great if you are TSA Pre.\nThe problem is that you still have to go through the upfront TSA passenger\nvalidation outlined previously. However, the TSA has attempted to solve this\nproblem by establishing a different lane for TSA Pre passengers to queue in\nto get their credentials checked. So now there are two lanes for two different\ntypes of passenger: a first lane called TSA Pre (as I have just mentioned) and\na second lane that I am going to call “punter”. In the small airports,\nunfortunately, there is still usually only one upfront, credential-checking\nagent to serve both of these lines.

These passengers still have to go through the same security checks as\nthe other punters, but they do not have to wait in a long line to get the\nupfront ID check. To be clear, this is technically not a TSA thing, it is\nusually an airport/airline thing.

There are three subtleties to this definition that need to be addressed\nup front.\n\nFirst, a Class of Service is different than a work item type (I spoke\nabout how to segment WIP into different types in Chapter 2). This point can\nbe very confusing because many a Kanban “expert” uses these two terms\ninterchangeably. They are not. At least, not necessarily. We can choose to\nsegment our work items into any number of types and there is no\nprescription as to what categories we use for those types. Some previous\nexamples I have given for work item types are user stories, defects, small\nenhancements, and the like. You could also segment work items into types\nusing the source or destination of the work. For example, we could call a\nunit of work a finance work item type, or we could say it is an external\nwebsite work item type. Or we could call a unit of work a regulatory work\nitem type or a technical debt work item type. The possibilities are endless.\nAnd, yes, one of the ways you could choose to segment types is by Class of\nService---but you do not have to. I have always thought a better way to\napply CoS is to make it a dimension of an existing type. For example, a\nwork item of type user story has an expedited CoS, a work item of type\nregulatory requirement has a fixed date CoS. But that is just personal\npreference. Just know that work item types and CoS are different. Do not let\nthe existing literature out there on this stuff confuse you.\n\nTo be clear, you can have any number of types of Class of Service as\n\nwell. The most talked about ones happen to be Expedite, Fixed Date,\nStandard, and Intangible. But those are only four examples of limitless kinds\nof Class of Service. Any time that you put a policy in place (explicit or not!)\naround the order in which you pull something through a process, then you\nhave introduced a Class of Service.\n\nThe second subtlety of the above definition is that CoS does not attach\nuntil a work item has been pulled into the process.

Additionally, it is entirely possible that once committed to, our SLA\nwould predict that we need not give any preferential pull order to that item.\nFor example, let’s assume that it is February 1 when we pull a new item into\nour process. Let’s further say that this new item has a due date of February\n28, and that the SLA for our process is 11 days. In this case, our SLA would\npredict that this item will complete well before its due date so there would be\nno point in giving it any preferential treatment.

Patrons of restaurants do not flow\nthrough in a strict FIFO ordering. To illustrate, let’s say a group is seated\nfirst at Table A. Then a different group is seated second at Table B. The\ngroup at Table B does not have to wait until the first group at Table A has\nfinished before the second group is allowed to leave. That would just be\nsilly. The groups are, however, usually seated in a First In First Served\n(FIFS) order. A (mostly) FIFS scheme is much more practical in the\nknowledge work context as well and usually is the best strategy from a\npredictability perspective.\n\nExtending the restaurant example, let’s say that a group of four people\narrives to an establishment that is currently full and they need to wait for a\ntable to open up in order to be seated. Let’s further say that a group of two\npeople arrives after the group of four and this second group needs to wait as\nwell. If the first table to open up seats only two people, then it is reasonable\nthat the group of two---who arrived second---would be seated first. This\nscenario happens all the time in knowledge work. Maybe a resource frees up\nand is ready to pull an item. But he does not have the expertise to work on\nthe item that has been waiting the longest (which should be his first choice).\nFrom a practical perspective, it would be reasonable for him to pull the item\nthat has been waiting the second longest (assuming, again, that he has the\nright skills to work on that second one). But remember, even though this\nmay be the best practical decision, it may not be the best predictable\ndecision. In this scenario, what are some longer term improvements you\ncould make for better predictability?\n\nThe point to all of this is that the further you stray from FIFO queuing,\n\nthe less predictable you are. That is not to say that there are not practical\nreasons why you should forfeit FIFO. And by the way, arbitrary business\nvalue reasons and fictional Cost of Delay calculations do not fall into this\npractical category. But more on that a little later.\n\nThe most common objection I get when I explain why teams should\n\nadopt FIFO (or FIFS, or mostly FIFS) and dump expedites is that,\n“Expedites happen all the time in our context and we can’t not work on\nthem”.

Why, look at FedEx, of course.\n\nFederal Express (FedEx) is an American shipping company that allows\n\nclients to send packages all over the world. For this example, though, let’s\nlimit the scope of our discussion to just the continental United States. Suffice\nit to say that FedEx knows a thing or two about flow and predictability, and\nthe company is worth studying.\n\nWhen a prospective customer wishes to ship a package via FedEx that\n\ncustomer has several service options to choose from. She can choose to it\nsend overnight, 2nd day air, and standard ground---to just name a few. All of\nthese service options are going to result in different CoS that FedEx uses in\norder to make sure that packages get to their destinations within the agreed\nSLA. Think about this for a second. In the U.S. there are thousands of\nlocations that FedEx will need to pick up packages from. On any given day,\nit is impossible for FedEx to proactively and deterministically know the\nexact number of packages, their respective requested CoS, their full\ndimensions, weight, etc. that will show up at any one of their locations. They\ncould have one shop that is swamped with overnight requests while another\nlocation remains relatively quiet. The magnitude of this problem is almost\nbeyond comprehension.\n\nThe incredible thing is, while I have not used FedEx a lot, I can tell you\nthat every time I have needed to send a package overnight it has arrived at its\nlocation on time. How does FedEx do it?\n\nThere are a lot of strategies that FedEx employs, but the one that is\nprobably most important is that at any given time FedEx has empty planes in\nthe air. Yes, I said empty planes. That way, if a location gets overwhelmed,\nor if packages get left behind because a regularly scheduled plane was full\nthen an empty plane is redirected (just-in-time it should be said) to the\nproblem spot. At any given time FedEx has “spares in the air”!\n\nA lot of people will tell you that Lean is all about waste elimination.\n\nBut imagine if the FedEx CFO was hyper-focused on waste elimination for\nprocess improvement. Would that CFO ever allow empty planes to be in the\nair at any given time for any reason? Of course not. Flying empty planes\nmeans paying pilots’ salaries, it means burning jet fuel, it means additional\nmaintenance and upkeep.

Pretty much the\nonly way to predictably deliver in the face of variability introduced by\ndifferent CoS is to build slack into the system. There is just no way around\nit.\n\nSo let’s get back to the “we have expedites that we cannot predict and\n\nthat we have to work on” argument. Armed with this information about\nvariability and slack, what do you think would happen if you went to your\nmanagement and said, “if we want to predictably deliver on all of the\nexpedites in our process (to say nothing of all of our other work), we need to\nhave some team members that sit around, do nothing, and wait for the\nexpedites to occur.” You better have your resume updated because after you\nget laughed out of the room you will be looking for a new job.\n\n“Ok, so you cannot have idle developers,” so-called CoS experts will\n\ntell you, “then what you need to do is put a strict limit on the number of\nexpedites that can be in your process at any given time.” They will further\nadvise you that the limit on expedites needs to be as small as possible---\npotentially as low as a WIP limit of one.

One of those errors is the advised use of an expedite lane on\na Kanban Board (or CoS in general). Now in this game, there is a lane\ndedicated for expedited items, and, further, there is an explicit WIP limit of\none for that lane. This is the exact implementation of the strategy that I just\nexplained. So what is the problem? At the end of the game, I take the teams\nthrough an analysis of the data that they generated while they played the\nsimulation (using all the techniques that have been outlined in the previous\nchapters). The data usually shows them that their standard items flow\nthrough the system in about ten or eleven days at the 85th percentile.

Sure, most companies will require a business case before a\nproject is started and this business case acts a proxy for business value. But,\nas you know, most business cases are anywhere from pure works of fiction\nto out and out lies. Basing pull decisions on disingenuous arguments is\nsuspect at best.\n\nLet’s put it another way. As I just mentioned, true business value can be\ndetermined only after delivery to the customer. Choices about what to work\non and when, then, are really just you placing bets on what you think the\ncustomer will find valuable. By introducing CoS and by giving preference to\nsome items in the process over other items means that you are gambling that\nthe customer will find those preferred items more valuable. The problem is\nthat when you lose that bet---and I guarantee you almost always will---you\nwill have not only lost the bet on the expedited item, but you will have also\nlost the bet for every other item in progress that you skipped over.\n\nHonestly, I am only mostly that cynical. I do believe that the business\n\nvalue of an item should be considered, but I believe it should only be\nconsidered at input queue replenishment time. After an item is placed in\nprocess then I believe the best long term strategy is to pull that item---and all\nother items---through the process as predictably as possible.

Things like production being\n\ndown that require all hands on deck? Or a new regulatory requirement that\ncould result in massive fines for noncompliance? Obviously, those things\nwill---and should---take precedence. But, just like the FedEx example, you\nshould study the rate of occurrence for those items and adjust your process\ndesign accordingly. That will potentially mean lowering overall process WIP.\nThat will probably mean making sure free resources look to help out with\nother items in process before pulling in new items. And so on.\n\nTo come full circle on our discussion about Little’s Law that was started\n\nin Chapter 3, I hope it is obvious for you to see how CoS represents a clear\nviolation of the fourth assumption of Little’s Law (and potentially the first\nand the third as well).

How could you ever expect to be predictable when using CoS\nas your standard process policy?\n\nConclusion\nIt is obvious that to solve the problem outlined at the beginning of this\nchapter, the TSA could simply hire more agents. At the very least you would\nwant to have a minimum of one agent per queue. This intervention would\npotentially solve the problem---or it would go a long way to alleviating it.\nNote that in this case, however, CoS would be eliminated. If each queue had\nits own server, then there would be no need for CoS. Wouldn’t it be great if\nall our problems could be solved by just adding more people? The reality is\nthat most companies do not have the money to keep hiring. That being the\ncase, we want to make sure that we are using the resources we do have as\nefficiently as possible. That means choosing pull policies that maximize our\nresources’ effectiveness and eliminating policies that make it harder for\nthose resources to do their jobs predictably.\n\nAlthough it probably sounds like it, I am not saying that CoS is\n\ninherently evil or that all CoS implementations are incorrect. I am, however,\ncoming at this from the perspective of predictability. With that consideration,\nwhat I am saying is that you need to consider all aspects of CoS before\nimplementing those policies. By definition, CoS will introduce variability\nand unpredictability into your process. The unpredictability manifests itself\n---among other things---as Flow Debt (Chapter 9). The truth is that the only\npart of your process that is more predictable with CoS is the highest priority\nclass. Overall, CoS will cause your process to actually take a predictability\nhit (see Figures 13.4 and 13.5). Are you really that confident that the upfront\nvalue decisions that you are making with CoS are worth more than all the\nnegative implications?\n\nThe arguments swirling around out there about why to use CoS are very\n\nseductive. The people making those arguments are very persuasive. I am\nhoping I have at least given you something to think about before assuming\nyou should start with CoS as a default.\n\nFor me, the better strategy is to consider an item’s forecasted value at\n\nqueue replenishment time.

It is a Burn Up chart or Projection Chart or something else, but it is\nmost definitely not a CFD. To review, there are two reasons why a\nprojections on CFDs are incorrect. The first reason is because to do a\nprojection the chart must have some type of backlog displayed. But CFDs\nshould not have backlogs on them. That is mistake number one. The second\nreason is that CFDs are for looking backward, they are not for making\nprojections about the future. That is mistake number two. The fact that it is\nnot a CFD is not a bad thing because this projection view can potentially be\nvery useful (used incorrectly it can also be very bad). I should point out\nhere that because I cannot call them CFDs, the term I am going to use for\nthese types of charts is going to be either Burn Up Charts or Projection\nCharts.\n\nMany teams are tempted to just perform a straight line projection off of\nthe Throughput line on a Burn Up chart. The calculation---it is reasoned---is\nfairly simple. If a backlog has 100 items in it and the team is averaging 10\nitems per week, then it is easy to draw a trend line off the Throughput line\nand see where it intersects the backlog line as above. If you drop a line\ndown to the X-axis at the point where the two lines intersect, then, voila,\nyou have your release date.\n\nThere are so many problems with this approach that I am not sure\nwhere to begin. The first, and potentially most obvious since we just talked\nabout it, is that once again this forecast is being based on an average. I have\nalready discussed several reasons why you should not do that so I will not\ngo into them here.\n\nSecondly, over time, there is going to be variability in both the\nBacklog and Average Throughput. Depending on the time horizon under\nconsideration, both the Backlog and Throughput can vary wildly (see the Scurve section below). Looking at this rather one-dimensional view of the\nworld could cause managers to either panic or be overly confident\ndepending on which way the variability pendulum swings on any given day.\nThirdly, there is no date range. That is one of our requirements for a\nproper forecast. No problem say the advocates. Let’s draw an optimistic line\nfor the backlog and a pessimistic line for the backlog.

How were the optimistic and\npessimistic backlog lines determined? The same should be asked of the\nThroughput lines. But most importantly, what is the probability of hitting\nthis range?\n\nA further complication of a straight line projection is that your\ncompletion rate over the long term is potentially not a straight line. As I\nmentioned before, any time you start a project with zero WIP and end with\nzero WIP, the resulting pattern of the Throughput line on the CFD mimics\nan “S-curve”. Using a straight line to approximate an S-curve is\nproblematic at best and dangerous at worst. There are overly complicated\nmethods to approximate S-curves out there (again with no range and\nprobabilities attached), and I am not going to get into them here, but I will\nsay that the effort put into generating those forecasts would be better spent\nusing more modern forecasting methods.\n\nJust as with Little’s Law, it is probably ok to perform a straight line\n\nprojection for the purposes of a quick gut check on project status. But any\ninsight you may gain is certainly not actionable. In fact, any action\nmotivated by this strategy would probably be akin to tampering.\n\nThe thing is, however, if you put in place all the predictability\nmeasures that I have talked about in this book up until now, then straight\nline projections do not necessarily give results that are that bad.

I am not going to tell\nyou otherwise. But even so, we might be able to tweak things a little bit to\ngive you more insight.\n\nIf you insist on using a Burn Up to do your projections, then might I\n\nsuggest you augment your charts with the percentiles off of your\nScatterplot? The way it would work is as follows. Start with your arrival\nand departure data for a CFD. Choose a completion date for your project (or\nrelease or whatever) and extend the timescale of the X-axis out to that\ncompletion date.

Anyone truly interested in applying this method to knowledge\nwork should review Troy Magennis’ work on Lean Forecasting. I am not\ngoing to reproduce all of that information here. Rather, my goal is to discuss\nwhy flow principles and flow metrics are necessary to make a Monte Carlo\napproach more actionable. Operating your process in the manner that I have\nexplained up until now is going to make it much easier for you to build more\naccurate models.

From this point forward I am going to use the terms “Monte\nCarlo Simulation” and “The Monte Carlo Method” interchangeably (my\napologies to the purists out there).

For the latter situation (when you do not have data), you\nare forced to choose a probability distribution for the value or values that\nyou are trying to simulate. This choice quickly gets into a philosophical\ndebate around what is the best type of probability distribution to use.

In Chapter 7 I\nshowed that Figure 7.5 demonstrates a scenario where Cycle Times are\nconstantly increasing. Ever increasing Cycle Times mean that any selection\nof data from a past timeframe is a poor indication of what might happen in a\nfuture timeframe.

But how do you get started? I would not be\ndoing my job if I did not give you at least some pointers on how to begin.\n\nDefining Your Process\nIt may seem obvious or trivial to you, but the very first thing you need to do\nto get started is define the boundaries of your process. As I mentioned in\nChapter 2, you must first decide on a point at which you consider work to\nhave entered (or arrived to) your process. You must then decide the point at\nwhich you consider work to have exited (departed from) your process.\nStarting with a definition of your process boundaries is essential as any\nwork items between these two boundaries can be considered WIP.\n\nRemember that these boundaries are independent of any sprint or\niteration definition. That is to say, if you use sprints or iterations to manage\nyour process then it is possible for work to arrive at any time during the\nsprint and it is possible for work to depart at any time during the sprint. This\nconcept may seem anathema to Scrum purists, yet the possibility remains.\nThat means that any time work comes into your process---regardless of\nwhether it is the beginning of a sprint or not---you need to count that work\nas arrived. Likewise, if any work exits your process---regardless of whether\nit is the end of a sprint or not---you need to count that work as departed.\nThe next thing you need to decide is which items that fall between\nthose two boundaries will count as WIP. As I also mentioned in Chapter 2,\nthe choice of items to call WIP is up to you, but make that choice and start\ntracking. As with anything, you can always tweak that decision later as you\nlearn more.\n\nLastly, consider which of your existing policies are in direct violation\nof the assumptions of Little’s Law.

Most people assume you\nneed copious amounts of data in order to glean any useful information. That\nis not necessarily correct. While more data is generally better, the truth is\nthat less (often much less) data can be good enough.\n\nFor example, Douglas Hubbard (whose book “How to Measure\nAnything” is listed in the Bibliography) advises his clients on his “Rule of\nFive”:\n\nRule of Five -- There is a 93.75% chance that the median of a population is between the\nsmallest and largest values in any random sample of five from that population.\n\nRecall from Chapter 10 that the median is the 50th percentile line on\nour Scatterplot. The Rule of Five seems remarkable but it is true (please see\nHubbard’s book for a detailed proof as to why this rule works). If you think\nof your process as a random Cycle Time number generator, then you will\nhave a very good idea of where the median of your Cycle Time data is after\nonly five items complete.\n\nWhile powerful, the Rule of Five only gets us to the median of our\npopulation---which is actually not a bad place to start. But how much more\ndata do we need to have confidence in the overall bounds of our process’s\nCycle Time? To answer that, let’s consider a dataset that is uniformly\ndistributed. A uniform distribution assumes that all samples from its\npopulation are equally probable. The textbook example of a uniform\ndistribution is rolling a fair, six-sided die. All numbers on the die have an\nequal chance of coming up on each throw. If you were to plot the results of\nseveral rolls, what would emerge over time is a histogram with equal-height\nbars for each number on the die. Uniform distributions are interesting to\nstudy as they have several useful properties. For example, let’s say we have\neleven samples from a uniformly distributed population. The fact that we\nknow we have a uniform distribution means that there is a 90% probability\nthat the next sample (i.e., the 12th sample) will be between the min and the", "source_file": "Actionable_Agile_Metrics_for_Predictability_An_Introduction_-_Daniel_S_Vacanti.pdf", "extraction_method": "pdfminer", "ocr_used": false, "has_table": false, "chapter_num": "16", "chapter_title": "Getting Started", "section_num": null, "section_title": null, "l1_summary": "tool in an agreed upon matter so that you can have confidence in any\nsubsequently collected data.

All you need to do is turn the above dates into WIP counts for the\nCFD, and subtract the first date in the workflow from the last date in the\nworkflow to calculate Cycle Time for the Scatterplot and Histogram. Again,\nI would strongly caution against using guidance found on many popular\nwebsites to do this because (a) those websites do not assume you have your\ndata in the proper format, and (b) the instructions they give can lead to\nimproperly constructed analytics.\n\nWhile Excel may be a great tool to use when just starting out, you will\n\nno doubt quickly run into some limitations with that particular software\npackage. First and foremost, Excel offers only a static view of your data. It\ndoes not allow you to readily interact with your analytics such as\ndynamically zooming in on a particular part of the graph, easily filtering out\ndifferent types of work items, doing on the fly metrics calculations, and so\nforth. Secondly, Excel can become a bit unwieldy if managing thousands or\ntens of thousands of rows of data spread across multiple teams or\ndepartments. Still, Excel is not a bad option when starting out to make some\nquick progress.\n\nYou should also know that most major Agile tools vendors include\n\nsome basic form of the analytics presented in this book.

{"segment_id": "00200", "page_num": 200, "segment": "favorite tool. There are several answers to this question. And each answer\nmust be considered carefully.\n\nThe first thing to consider is that while it is true that most tools ship\nwith something called a “Cumulative Flow Diagram” I have yet to see an\nelectronic tool that generates a CFD correctly (barring the one that I will\ndiscuss shortly). The telltale sign that a CFD has not been constructed\nproperly is if it has lines on it that go down. I explained why this is the case\nand introduced it as CFD Property #2 in Chapter 4, but it is worth\nreiterating here:\n\nCFD Property #2: Due to its cumulative nature, no line on a CFD can ever decrease\n(go down).\n\nAny time you see a CFD that has one or more lines go down, then you\ncan immediately tell that whoever constructed that CFD did not account for\narrivals and/or departures correctly. Not accounting for arrivals and\ndepartures properly invalidates any resultant analysis of your chart.\n\nTo illustrate the point a little better, if you are currently using an\nelectronic tool for reporting, have it generate its CFD for you. If you do not\nsee any lines on the chart that go down, that is a good sign. However, as a\ntest, try to “turn off” some of the latter workflow steps (if you can) starting\nfrom the bottom up. Do you see any of the remaining lines go down now? If\nso, it is a safe bet that the overall CFD has not been built according to all of\nthe required CFD principles.\n\nThe second telltale sign that a CFD is suspect is if it contains a state\n\ncalled “Backlog”. Strictly speaking, there is nothing wrong with displaying\na backlog on a CFD, but the question remains how is the tool calculating\nthe overall process approximate average Cycle Time (does it even call this\ncalculation an approximate average Cycle Time or does it lead you to\nbelieve it is an exact Cycle Time)? Again, I refer you to CFD Property #1\nfrom Chapter 4:\n\nCFD Property #1: The top line of a Cumulative Flow Diagram always represents the\ncumulative arrivals to a process.

{"segment_id": "00201", "page_num": 201, "segment": "This property demands that overall process approximate average Cycle\nTime always be calculated from the top line of a CFD through to the bottom\nline of a CFD. If your chart includes a backlog and your tool’s computed\nCycle Time does not include the time spent in the backlog, then, again, you\nshould be skeptical about whether the tool is calculating flow metrics\nproperly.\n\nAnother pitfall to watch out for is how your Scatterplot is generated---\n\nassuming your tool even generates a Scatterplot. Your tool may call its\nScatterplot a “Control Chart”---which it most certainly is not. As I\nmentioned in Chapter 10, why Control Charts (at least Control Charts in the\nShewhart and Deming tradition) are probably not applicable to knowledge\nwork is beyond the scope of this book. The thing you need to watch out for,\nthough, is that if your tool takes a “Control Chart” approach, it is almost\ncertainly assuming that your data is normally distributed. When looking at\nyour Agile tool’s Control Chart, look to see if displays lines that say\nsomething like “mean plus one standard deviation” or “μ + σ”. It might also\ngive you an associated percentage akin to the standard percentages that I\ndemonstrated in Chapter 10. In this case, that percentage is going to be\nbased on an assumption that your data is normally distributed---which I can\nguarantee it is not. How do I know it is not? Look at your Histogram. You\nmay remember from your statistics training that the shape of a normal\ndistribution is a bell curve. When you look at your Histogram you will see\nthat your data does not follow a bell curve pattern.\n\nUsing the mean plus a standard deviation (or the mean plus any\nnumber of standard deviations) approach and then associating the result\nwith percentiles is dangerous given that your data is not normally\ndistributed. You will get calculation errors that are not insignificant and you\nwill potentially make poor decisions based on bad data.\n\nThe moral of this story is that when you are starting out with this type\n\nof analysis, do not necessarily trust the data or charts that your Agile tool\ndisplays for you. Do not trust its associated calculations. It may seem\ntedious, but I would encourage you to initially track some sample data\nyourself and then compare it to what your electronic tool generates for you.\nYou may be surprised at how different those results can be.

We were releasing large\nbatches of new features and enhancements once a year (mostly because that\nis the frequency at which we’ve always released). Practices such as CI,\nTDD, story-driven development, continuous customer interaction, pair\nprogramming, planning poker, and relative point-based estimation were for\nthe most part well integrated into our teams and process. Our experience\nshowed that Scrum and Agile practices vastly improved collaboration across\nroles, improved customer functionality, improved code quality and speed.\nOur Scrum process includes all analysis, development and testing of\n\nfeatures. A feature is declared “done” only once it has passed validation\ntesting in a fully integrated environment performed by a Test Engineer\nwithin each Scrum Team. Once all release features are complete, Siemens\nperforms another round of regression testing, followed by customer beta\ntesting before declaring general availability and shipping to all our\ncustomers.\n\nDespite many improvements and real benefits realized by our Agile\nadoption, our overall success was limited. We were continually challenged to\nestimate and deliver on committed release dates. Meeting regulatory\nrequirements and customer expectations requires a high degree of certainty\nand predictability. Our internal decision checkpoints and quality gates\nrequired firm commitments. Our commitment to customers, internal\nstakeholder expectations and revenue forecasts required accurate release\nscope and delivery forecasts that carry a very high premium for delay.\nAt the program and team levels, sprint and release deadlines were\ncharacterized by schedule pressure often requiring overtime and the metrics\nwe collected were not providing the transparency needed to clearly gauge\ncompletion dates or provide actionable insight into the state of our teams.\nIn the trenches, our teams were also challenged to plan and complete\nstories in time-boxed sprint increments.

In addition,\nwhenever a story or feature was blocked (for a variety of reasons such as\nwaiting for a dependency from another team, waiting for customer\nvalidation, inability to test because of environmental or build break issues,\netc.), teams would simply start the next story or feature so that we could\nclaim the points which we had committed to achieve. So, while velocity\nburn-ups could look in line with expectations, multiple features were not\nbeing completed on any regular cadence, leading to bottle-necks especially\nat the end of the release as the teams strove to complete and test features.\nDuring this period we operated under the assumption that if we mastered\nAgile practices, planned better, and worked harder we would be successful.\nHeroic efforts were expected.\n\nIn November of 2011 executive management chartered a small team of\ndirector level managers to coordinate and drive process improvement across\nthe PLM organization, with the key goal of finally realizing the\npredictability, operational efficiency, and quality gains originally promised\nby our Agile approach.

In one case by analyzing Throughput (story run\nrate) and Cycle Time for each column (specifying, testing and developing),\nwe were able to clearly see where we were experiencing capacity problems.\nWe were also able to gauge our “flow efficiency” by calculating the\npercentage of time stories were being worked on or “touched” versus\n“waiting” or “blocked”. Wait time is the time a story sits in an inactive or\ndone queue because moving to the next active state is prevented by WIP\nlimits. Blocked time is the time work on a story is impeded, including\nimpediments such as build-breaks, defects, waiting for customer validation\netc. The calculation is made by capturing time spent in the “specifying done\nand developing done” column plus any additional blocked time which we\ncall “wait time”.

This was actually easy to spot as the\n“developing done” state on the CFD consistently had stories queued up\nwaiting for the “testing” column WIP limits to allow them to move into\n“testing”.

In analyzing the metrics, Siemens\nalso discovered that there was no correlation between story point estimates\nand actual Cycle Time.\n\nSiemens also gained the ability to more accurately track costs; as we\ndiscovered that we could in fact correlate Cycle Time to actual budgetary\nallocations. Siemens could now definitively calculate the unit costs of a\nstory, feature and/or a release. By using the modelling tool we could now\nforecast likely costs along with dates. Moreover, we could put an accurate\ndollar value on reductions or increases in Cycle Times.\n\nThe metrics also improved communication with key non PLM stakeholders. It had always been difficult translating relative story points to\ncorporate stakeholders who were always looking for time based answers and\nwho found our responses based on relative story points confusing. Metrics\nsuch as Cycle Time and Throughput are very tangible and especially familiar\nin a company such as Siemens with a large manufacturing sector.\n\nImplementing Kanban also had a positive impact on employee morale.\nWithin the first month, Scrum-masters reported more meaningful stand-ups.\nThis sentiment was especially expressed and emphasized by our offshore\ncolleagues, who now felt a much higher sense of inclusion during the standup. Having the same board and visualization in front of everyone made a\nhuge difference on those long distant conference calls between colleagues in\ndiametrically opposed time zones. While there was some skepticism as\nexpected, overall comments from the teams were positive; people liked it.\nThis was confirmed in an anonymous survey we did four months into the\nfirst release that we used Kanban: the results and comments from employees\nwere overwhelmingly positive.
