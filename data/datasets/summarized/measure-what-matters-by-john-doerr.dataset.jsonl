As much as I\nhate process, good ideas with great execution are how you make magic.\n\nI\n\nAnd that’s where OKRs come in.\n\nJohn Doerr showed up one day in 1999 and delivered a lecture to us on\nobjectives and key results, and how we should run the company based on his\nexperience at Intel. We knew Intel was run well, and John’s talk made a lot of\nintuitive sense, so we decided we’d give it a try. I think it’s worked out pretty\nwell for us.\n\nOKRs are a simple process that helps drive varied organizations forward.\n\nWe have adapted how we use it over the years. Take it as a blueprint and\nmake it yours, based on what you want to see happen!\n\nFor leaders, OKRs give a lot of visibility into an organization. They also\nprovide a productive way to push back. For example, you might ask: “Why\ncan’t users load a video on YouTube almost instantly? Isn’t that more\nimportant than this other goal you’re planning to do next quarter?”\n\nI’m glad to join in celebrating the memory of Bill Campbell, which John\n\nhas done very nicely at the conclusion of the book. Bill was a fantastically\nwarm human being who had the gift of almost always being right---especially\nabout people. He was not afraid to tell anyone about how “full of shit” they\nwere, and somehow they would still like him even after that. I miss Bill’s\nweekly haranguing very much.

In general, each objective should be tied to five or fewer key results. (See chapter\n4, “Superpower #1: Focus and Commit to Priorities.”)\n\nSet goals from the bottom up. To promote engagement, teams and individuals should\nbe encouraged to create roughly half of their own OKRs, in consultation with managers.\nWhen all goals are set top-down, motivation is corroded. (See chapter 7, “Superpower\n#2: Align and Connect for Teamwork.”)\n\nNo dictating. OKRs are a cooperative social contract to establish priorities and\ndefine how progress will be measured. Even after company objectives are closed to\ndebate, their key results continue to be negotiated. Collective agreement is essential to\nmaximum goal achievement. (See chapter 7, “Superpower #2: Align and Connect for\nTeamwork.”)\n\nStay flexible. If the climate has changed and an objective no longer seems practical\n\nor relevant as written, key results can be modified or even discarded mid-cycle. (See\nchapter 10, “Superpower #3: Track for Accountability.”)\n\nDare to fail. “Output will tend to be greater,” Grove wrote, “when everybody strives\n\nfor a level of achievement beyond [their] immediate grasp. . . . Such goal-setting is\nextremely important if what you want is peak performance from yourself and your\nsubordinates.” While certain operational objectives must be met in full, aspirational\nOKRs should be uncomfortable and possibly unattainable. “Stretched goals,” as Grove\ncalled them, push organizations to new heights. (See chapter 12, “Superpower #4:\nStretch for Amazing.”)\n\nA tool, not a weapon. The OKR system, Grove wrote, “is meant to pace a person---\n\nto put a stopwatch in his own hand so he can gauge his own performance. It is not a\nlegal document upon which to base a performance review.” To encourage risk taking\nand prevent sandbagging, OKRs and bonuses are best kept separate. (See chapter 15,\n“Continuous Performance Management: OKRs and CFRs.”)\n\nBe patient; be resolute. Every process requires trial and error. As Grove told his\niOPEC students, Intel “stumbled a lot of times” after adopting OKRs: “We didn’t fully\nunderstand the principal purpose of it. And we are kind of doing better with it as time\ngoes on.” An organization may need up to four or five quarterly cycles to fully embrace\nthe system, and even more than that to build mature goal muscle.", "source_file": "measure-what-matters-by-john-doerr.pdf", "extraction_method": "pdfminer", "ocr_used": false, "has_table": false, "chapter_num": null, "chapter_title": null, "section_num": null, "section_title": null, "l1_summary": "(See chapter 7, “Superpower\n#2: Align and Connect for Teamwork.”) (See chapter 7, “Superpower #2: Align and Connect for\nTeamwork.”) (See\nchapter 10, “Superpower #3: Track for Accountability.”)", "l2_summary": "(See chapter\n4, “Superpower #1: Focus and Commit to Priorities.”) (See chapter 7, “Superpower\n#2: Align and Connect for Teamwork.”) (See chapter 7, “Superpower #2: Align and Connect for\nTeamwork.”) (See\nchapter 10, “Superpower #3: Track for Accountability.”) (See chapter 12, “Superpower #4:\nStretch for Amazing.”) (See chapter 15,\n“Continuous Performance Management: OKRs and CFRs.”)"}

Now there was a sign of\nserious goal orientation.\n\nI found Brett highly skilled at identifying priorities and enlisting others to\nbuy in. In 2012, he and his brother David made the Forbes honor roll of “30\nUnder 30 Education.” But with accelerating scale, their company needed\nmore focus. OKRs guaranteed a process that they’d already begun.\n\n---\n\nBrett Kopf: Growing up in Skokie, Illinois, I struggled to focus at school. I was fine if I could move\naround, but sitting at a desk for me was torture. A forty-minute math lesson felt like eternity. I was the\nkid who was always messing with my neighbor or blowing spitballs. I just wasn’t engaged.\n\nI was tested in fifth grade, and then came the diagnosis: attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and\n\ndyslexia. Organizing words and letters was tough for me. Numbers were tougher still.\n\nBoth my parents were entrepreneurs, and I’d see them up and working at five in the morning. I was\n\nworking my butt off, too, but my grades kept sinking and my confidence with them. It only got worse\nin high school, on the North Side of Chicago. When other kids called me stupid, I believed them.\n\nThen, junior year, a teacher named Denise Whitefield began working with me one-on-one---and\nchanged my life. Each day she’d begin by asking, “What do you have to do today?” I’d run down my\nlist: a history worksheet, an English essay, an upcoming math test. Then she’d say something really\nsmart: “Okay, let’s just pick one and talk about it.” We focused on one thing at a time, and I’d get it\ndone. “Just keep trying,” she encouraged me. “You’ll get it. I have all day.” The panicked beating in\nmy chest subsided. School would never be easy for me, but I began to believe I could handle it.\n\nMy mother spoke to Mrs. Whitefield every week, came into school at least once a month. They\nwere a force in lockstep, Team Brett, and they would not let me fail. I’m sure I didn’t fully get the\nimportance of their connection, but it planted a seed.\n\nEven after my grades improved, the college-prep ACT exam---answer six hundred questions and\ndon’t move for four hours--- was a horror movie for a person with ADHD. But somehow I made it into\nMichigan State, my first big win.\n\nWhen people try to crack the country’s massive problems in education, they usually start with\ncurriculum or “accountability,” which is code for test scores. What gets lost are the human connections.\nThat’s what Remind is all about.\n\nTwitter for Education\n\nLike many ventures, Remind began with one person’s problem. As a college freshman, I was hopeless\nwith academic deadlines and schedules, which my professors seemed to change on a whim. Cut off\nfrom my support system, I failed at three majors before settling on agricultural economics, the easiest\none I could find. But I still had five syllabi per semester, and each syllabus might contain thirty-five\nassignments and quizzes and tests. Success in college is a matter of time management.

Adding\ninsult, I had to hunt for that lousy grade on a clunky web-based system on my laptop. My friends and I\ntexted on our BlackBerrys in real time---why couldn’t our school data be at our fingertips, too? Why\ncouldn’t teachers connect with students on their smartphones anytime, anywhere? I felt driven to build\nsomething to help kids like me. I called my older brother, David, who was working in web services\nsecurity for a big Chicago insurance firm. I said, “You have twenty-four hours to decide if you want to\nstart that company with me.” Five minutes later he called back and said, “Okay, I’m in.”\n\nFor two years, David and I fumbled in the dark. We knew nothing about technology and less about\nproduct development or operations. (My total real-world experience was an internship at Kraft Foods,\nwhere I’d mostly stocked cookies.) Random students shared their syllabi, and I plugged them into\nDavid’s Excel macros to send alerts to their phones: “Brett Kopf, you have a quiz at eight a.m.\ntomorrow in History 101, don’t forget to study.” The system was archaic and absolutely unscalable. But\nfor a few hundred active users, including me, it worked. I graduated from Michigan State.\n\nIn early 2011, I moved to Chicago to work on our app full time. With $30,000 from friends and\nfamily, David and I did the full-monty entrepreneur thing, pasta dinners every night. And we failed\nbecause I was arrogant. We spent lots of time meeting potential investors and working up intricate\nwebsite schematics, and no time learning about teachers’ problems. We weren’t yet focused on what\ncounted.\n\nDown to a few hundred dollars, our company cheated death by getting into Imagine K12, the\nSilicon Valley start-up accelerator for the education market. Our mission statement went something\nlike: “Remind101: A safe way for teachers to message students and parents. We’re building the most\npowerful communication platform in education and using SMS as the ‘hook.’ Think Twitter, for\neducation.” There were millions of children with learning issues like mine, and countless teachers\nstruggling to help them. I was bold or naive enough to think we could do something about it.\n\nWith our Demo Day opportunity ninety days out, David quit his job and we moved to the Valley.\n\nWe learned the three watchwords for entrepreneurs:\n\nSolve a problem\n\nBuild a simple product\n\nTalk to your users\n\nWhile David locked himself in a room to teach himself how to code, I focused on a single ten-week\n\ngoal: to interview 200 teachers across the United States and Canada. (I guess you could say that was\nmy first OKR.) After contacting 500 teachers on Twitter, I wound up with 250 one-on-ones, exceeding\nmy objective. When you listen to enough educators in the trenches, you learn pretty quickly that off-site\ncommunication ranks high among their pain points. At final bell, teachers were plastering sticky notes\n---Homework’s due tomorrow--- on students’ shoulders. Couldn’t we do better than that?\n\nTraditional phone trees and permission slips were labor intensive and unreliable. On the other hand,\n\ntexting between thirty-year-old teachers and twelve-year-old children was loaded with liability.\nTeachers needed a secure platform with no personal data attached, something accessible yet private.\nAnd they needed less work, not more.\n\nBy Day 15, we had a crude beta version of Remind. On a sheet of printer paper, over hand-drawn\n\nsymbols for mobile phones and email, I scrawled, “Your students can receive your messages. . . .”\nBelow were three options: “Invite,” “Print,” “Share.” After reaching a teacher on Skype, I’d hold the\npaper to the screen and say, “You can type any message you want to your students, hit the button, and\nthey’ll never see your phone number or social networking profile.” I did this countless times, and the", "source_file": "measure-what-matters-by-john-doerr.pdf", "extraction_method": "pdfminer", "ocr_used": false, "has_table": false, "chapter_num": null, "chapter_title": null, "section_num": null, "section_title": null, "l1_summary": "Why\ncouldn’t teachers connect with students on their smartphones anytime, anywhere?

Teachers could sign up on the web, form a virtual “class,” and\nprovide a dedicated number to students and parents for text messaging. We scaled quickly, a good sign\n---130,000 messages within three weeks of launch. We had what every new company wanted, a\nhockey-stick growth chart. On Demo Day, I entered a big, buzzing room with eleven other start-ups\nand a hundred investors. I had two minutes to make my pitch, followed by two hours of frantic\nmingling. I handed out my card to at least forty people.\n\nGrowth costs money. By early 2012, my brother and I were $10,000 in debt. But then Miriam\nRivera and Clint Korver’s Ulu Ventures seeded us with a save-the-day $30,000. Another infusion\nfollowed from Maneesh Arora, the Google product manager who later founded MightyText and\nbecame my mentor. Remind kept scaling like crazy on our seed-capital shoestring.

I spoke to teachers for feedback, and they’d put out the word\nto fifty colleagues. Since our service was free, we didn’t need school district approval.\n\nOur goals stayed strictly qualitative until the fall of 2013, when we hit six million users and raised\nSeries A funding from Chamath Palihapitiya and the Social+Capital Partnership. Maneesh had already\nbeen nudging us to back our decisions with more data, and Chamath showed us how to paint a picture\nwith one page of it. Plus he taught us to discern what was inessential , like our number of registered\nusers. Nobody cared how many teachers registered on Remind if they never came back to use it.\n\nBy the time John Doerr saw our goals posted above our office toilet, they were more concrete. We\nlisted three metrics: Weekly Active Teachers (WAT), Monthly Active Teachers (MAT), and retention.\nThen I’d squeeze in a few quarterly initiatives: migrate the databases, build the app, hire four\n\npeople.

Say a teacher\nwants to remind a fifth-grade class to bring the novel they’re reading to school---and keep reminding\nthem every Monday morning without resending. That’s a classic “delight” feature, but was it worth the\nengineering time to make it a top-line priority? Would it move the needle for user engagement? When\nour answer was no , we decided to shelve it---a tough call for a teacher-centric organization. Without\nour new goal-setting discipline and focus, we might not have held our ground.\n\nOKRs gave us a way to move forward that wasn’t all top-down. After voting on the quarter’s top\n\nobjectives, the leadership team would go to our contributors and say, “Here’s what we think is\nimportant and why.” And the contributors would say, “Okay, how do we get there?” Since it was all\nwritten down, everybody knew what everyone else was doing. There was no confusion or Mondaymorning quarterbacking. OKRs took politics out of play.\n\nThe system helped my personal focus, too. I tried to limit myself to three or four individual\nobjectives, tops. I printed them out and kept them close on my notepad and next to my computer,\neverywhere I went. Each morning, I’d say to myself, “These are my three buckets, and what am I doing\ntoday to move the company forward?” That’s a great question for any leader, with or without a learning\nissue.\n\nI was wide open about my progress or lack of it. I’d tell my people, “Here are the three things I’m\nworking on, and I’m failing at this one miserably.” As companies scale, people need to see the CEO’s\npriorities and how they can align for maximum impact.

It may take a\nquarter or two to overcome your managers’ resistance and get them acclimated to OKRs---to view them\nnot as a necessary evil, or some perfunctory exercise, but as a practical tool to fulfill your\norganization’s top priorities.\n\nUntil your executives are fully on board, you can’t expect contributors to follow suit---especially\n\nwhen a company’s OKRs are aspirational. The more challenging an objective, the more tempting it\nmay be to abandon it. People naturally look to their bosses in setting goals and following through. If the\nofficers jump ship in the middle of a stormy voyage, you can’t expect the sailors to bring it into port.\nIn mid-2016, we tried again, with a renewed level of OKR commitment. But even as I saw our\nexecutive team buy in, I knew I couldn’t be complacent. As the leader, it was my job to keep after\npeople. I would email our contributors to commit to creating individual OKRs. If they didn’t respond, I\nwould reach out to them via Slack, the team messaging app. If they still didn’t hear me, I would text\nthem. And if they still didn’t listen, I would grab them and say, “Please do your OKRs!”\n\nTo inspire true commitment, leaders must practice what they teach. They must model the behavior\n\nthey expect of others. After sharing my individual OKRs at an all-hands meeting, I was surprised by\njust how much it helped the company rally around the process. It showed everyone that I, too, was\naccountable. Our contributors feel free to evaluate my OKRs and tell me how to improve them, which\nhas made all the difference.

A healthy OKR environment\nstrikes a balance between alignment and autonomy, common purpose and\ncreative latitude. The “professional employee,” Peter Drucker wrote, “needs\nrigorous performance standards and high goals. . . . But how he does his work\nshould always be his responsibility and his decision.” At Intel, Grove took a\ndim view of “managerial meddling”: “[T]he subordinate will begin to take a\nmuch more restricted view of what is expected of him, showing less initiative\nin solving his own problems and referring them instead to his [or her]\nsupervisor. . . . [T]he output of the organization will consequently be reduced.\n. . .”\n\nAn optimal OKR system frees contributors to set at least some of their\nown objectives and most or all of their key results. People are led to stretch\nabove and beyond, to set more ambitious targets and achieve more of those\nthey set: “ The higher the goals, the higher the performance.” People who\nchoose their destination will own a deeper awareness of what it takes to get\nthere.\n\nWhen our how is defined by others, the goal won’t engage us to the same\ndegree.

{"segment_id": "00079", "page_num": 79, "segment": "When we began to implement OKRs, it was harder than anticipated. We didn’t appreciate how much\nthought it took to create the right company objectives, and then to cascade them down to drive\ncontributors’ behavior. We found it challenging to strike a balance between high-level, strategic\nthinking and more granular, directive communication. Once we had our Series A funding and scaled up\nour leadership team, our realm of the possible expanded. In a push for accountability, we set one big\ndedicated goal for each leader. We created company OKRs for people instead of matching people to\nour OKRs---we had it backward. Some objectives were too narrow, others too nebulous. If an HR\nmanager got stuck trying to connect to the high-level goals for product or revenue, we’d add a top-line\nobjective just for that person. Soon we had a cornucopia of company OKRs, but what really mattered at\nMyFitnessPal? We’d lost the forest for the trees.\n\nIn 2013, as we jumped from ten to thirty people, I assumed we’d become 200 percent more\nproductive. I’d underestimated how much scaling slows you down. New engineers need extensive\ntraining before they can be as proficient as your holdovers. And with multiple engineers developing the\nsame project, we had to build new processes to keep them from overriding one another. In the\ntransition, productivity took a hit.\n\nWhen you come down to it, alignment is about helping people understand what you want them to\ndo. Most contributors will be motivated to ladder up to the top-line OKRs---assuming they know where\nto set the ladder. As our team got larger and more layered, we confronted new issues. One product\nmanager was working on Premium, the enhanced subscription version of our app. Another focused on\nour API platform, to enable third parties like Fitbit to connect to MyFitnessPal and write data to it or\napplications on top of it. The third addressed our core login experience. All three had individual OKRs\nfor what they hoped to accomplish---so far, so good.\n\nThe problem was our shared engineering team, which got caught in the middle. The engineers\nweren’t aligned with the product managers’ objectives. They had their own infrastructure OKRs, to\nkeep the plumbing going and the lights on. We assumed they could do it all---a big mistake. They got\nconfused about what they should be working on, which could change without notice. (Sometimes it\nboiled down to which product manager yelled loudest.) As the engineers switched between projects\nfrom week to week, their efficiency dragged. When returning to a product after an interruption, they’d\nhave to ask themselves: How does this go again? The Premium work was especially urgent for revenue,\nyet it went in fits and starts.\n\nI felt super-frustrated. We’d hired all these talented people and were spending tons of money, but\nwe weren’t going any faster. Things came to a head over a top-priority marketing OKR for personalized\nemails with targeted content. The objective was well constructed: We wanted to drive a certain\nminimum number of monthly active users to our blog. One important key result was to increase our\nclick-through rate from emails. The catch was that no one in marketing had thought to inform\nengineering, which had already set its own priorities that quarter. Without buy-in from the engineers,\nthe OKR was doomed before it started. Even worse, Albert and I didn’t find out it was doomed until\nour quarterly postmortem. (The project got done a quarter late.)\n\nThat was our wake-up call, when we saw the need for more alignment between teams. Our OKRs\nwere well crafted, but implementation fell short. When departments counted on one another for crucial\nsupport, we failed to make the dependency explicit. Coordination was hit-and-miss, with deadlines\nblown on a regular basis. We had no shortage of objectives, but our teams kept wandering away from\none another.\n\nThe following year, we tried to fix the problem with periodic integration meetings for the executive\nteam. Each quarter our department heads presented their goals and identified dependencies. No one left\nthe room until we’d answered some basic questions: Are we meeting everyone’s needs for buy-in? Is a\nteam overstretched? If so, how can we make their objectives more realistic?\n\nAlignment doesn’t mean redundancy.

Our objectives got more precise,\nour key results more measurable, our achievement rate higher. It took us two or three quarters to really\nget the hang of it, particularly for product features keyed to a broad objective. It’s not easy to predict\nthe market for the conceptually new; we’d wildly beat our metric or wildly miss. So we switched it up.\nWe began pinning our key results to deadlines instead of revenue or projected users. (Example:\n“Launch MFP Premium by 5/1/15.”) After a feature launched and some real data came back, we’d be in\na stronger position to assess its impact and potential. Then our next round of OKRs could be more\nrealistically keyed (or stretched) to projected outputs.\n\nAt times we’d see our team choosing lower-risk key results, like sending emails here or push\nnotifications there. The more ambitious the stretch in the objective, the more conservatively people\nmade their KRs---a classic unintended consequence. So we learned to design our goals to fit the\ncontext.

I had three additional apps to coordinate, each with a different culture and working style.\nAt scale, alignment grows exponentially more complex. How would we show four hundred people\n\nwhat we were trying to achieve, to help them align with us and with one another? How could we get\neverybody rowing in the same direction? In the beginning, I found it really hard to do; I can hardly\nimagine how Amazon or Apple manages. When we introduced OKRs throughout our division, it made\na big difference.\n\nA few weeks after our acquisition, my boss called an off-site leadership meeting for twenty people,\nincluding Connected Fitness stakeholders across the company.

All three\nhad preconceived notions of what they could expect from us, with no visibility into what other teams\nwere asking.

Then, in 2013, I became CIO. I made the switch because I loved the company, and I knew\nIT needed to evolve to help Intuit on its new mission. It was a stressful, exciting time. The organization\nwas pivoting in several directions at once: from desktop software to cloud-based software, from a\nclosed platform to one that was open to thousands of third-party apps, from a North American company\nto a global company. As we leaned into our long-term strategy to become an integrated ecosystem, we\ngradually changed from a house of brands (TurboTax, Quicken, QuickBooks) to the branded house of\nIntuit.\n\nIn the storm of any disruption, IT will bear the brunt of in-house frustrations.

People might try to look into what’s going on outside their own\ndepartment, but they often don’t know where to start or have the time to follow up.\n\nAt Intuit, change started at the top. To jump-start our transformation, our chairman and CEO, Brad\nSmith, installed a company-wide goal-setting system. Brad is very conscious and intentional about this.\nOnce each month, managers meet with their reports to discuss individual goals. The system has built-in,\n360-degree feedback, with both parties comparing notes on a regular basis.\n\nOur company has a long cultural history around learning and experimentation. We try a lot of\nthings, keep the elements that work best, and adapt them to make them our own. I agreed to partner\nwith HR to try OKRs in Enterprise Business Solutions, or EBS (our moniker for IT). Back in 2014, I\nfirst discovered objectives and key results while Googling “goal setting.” My research suggested that\nOKRs might help us change the way we operate, even how we perceive ourselves.\n\nModern IT goes way beyond checking off boxes to process help tickets or change requests. It’s\nabout adding value to the business---shedding redundant clone systems, creating new functionality,\nfinding future-oriented solutions. To become the team Intuit needed, our EBS would need to change\nroot and branch. Our leaders had to give people air cover to back-burner some day-to-day tasks and\nfocus on more valuable, longer-term initiatives.\n\nToday, every employee in my department owns three to five business objectives per quarter, along\n\nwith one or two personal ones. The system is powerful precisely because it is so simple---and so\ntransparent. For our OKRs to be effective, I knew they’d have to be visible through all of Intuit, even if\nno one outside EBS used them. I wanted everyone in the company to know exactly what we were\ndoing, and how, and why. When people understand your priorities and constraints, they’re more apt to\ntrust you when something goes sideways.\n\nEarly on, I found it challenging to separate my individual goals from the department’s OKRs. As\nIT’s leader, I thought they should logically coincide. But it wasn’t a good optic. Most of our top-level\nobjectives endured from quarter to quarter, typically for eighteen months. Down the line, teams and\nindividuals would modify their own OKRs as the environment shifted and we kept making progress.\nAnd they were asking, quite reasonably, “What is the CIO doing if his goals never change?” I got the\nmessage. Now I have my own objectives, and I ladder up to our top-level OKRs like everyone else.\n\nBeyond our base in the Bay Area, we made it a point to implement the system worldwide. EBS has\nformal teams in four U.S. regions and in Bangalore, the high-tech center of southern India, plus support\nteams in every Intuit location around the globe. When people work outside the center, they’re left to\nwonder what gets done at headquarters. (And headquarters may wonder about them, too.) OKRs ended\nthe mystery. They made us more cohesive; they brought us together.\n\nOne of our top-level EBS objectives is to “rationalize, modernize, and secure all technology used to\n\nrun Intuit.” (See here .) Lately, whenever I travel to see a team in Texas or Arizona, I hear our people\nsaying, “This project is rationalizing our portfolio.” Or: “How can we modernize that system?” No\nmatter where they happen to be stationed, they’re using the same three verbs. When a new project\ncomes up for discussion, they’ll ask one another how it fits into our OKR template.

So then I stopped sending notes, and look what happened: this quarter, SEVERAL of\nyou didn’t get your OKRs done on time, and several others didn’t grade your Q2 OKRs."}

Research suggests\nthat making measured headway can be more incentivizing than public\nrecognition, monetary inducements, or even achieving the goal itself. Daniel\nPink, the author of Drive , agrees: “ The single greatest motivator is ‘making\nprogress in one’s work.’ The days that people make progress are the days\nthey feel most motivated and engaged.”\n\nMost goal management platforms use visual aids to show progress toward\n\nobjectives and key results. Unlike steps on Fitbit, OKRs don’t require daily\ntracking. But regular check-ins---preferably weekly---are essential to prevent\nslippage. As Peter Drucker observed, “ Without an action plan, the executive\nbecomes a prisoner of events. And without check-ins to reexamine the plan as\nevents unfold, the executive has no way of knowing which events really\nmatter and which are only noise.”\n\nAs noted in chapter 4, the simple act of writing down a goal increases\nyour chances of reaching it. Your odds are better still if you monitor progress\nwhile sharing the goal with colleagues---two integral OKR features. In one\nCalifornia study, people who recorded their goals and sent weekly progress\nreports to a friend attained 43 percent more of their objectives than those who\nmerely thought about goals without sharing them.\n\n---\n\nOKRs are adaptable by nature.

I don’t think I invented anything there, but I\ndid watch and learn. Then Patty Stonesifer brought in OKRs, the green-yellow-red approach, and it\nworked. When we used OKRs with our grant reviews, I felt good about what we were going after. I was\nstill running Microsoft, and my time was limited, and Patty had to make things very efficient between\nus, to make sure we agreed. The goals process was a big part of that. There were two cases where I\nturned down a grant in the end because the goals weren’t clear enough. The OKR system made me\nconfident I was making the right call.\n\nI’m a huge fan of goals, but they need to be handled correctly. At one point, the malaria team\n\nthought we’d eradicate the disease by 2015, which wasn’t realistic. When a goal is too aspirational, it’s\nbad for credibility. In philanthropy, I see people confusing objectives with missions all the time. A\nmission is directional. An objective has a set of concrete steps that you’re intentionally engaged in and\nactually trying to go for. It’s fine to have an ambitious objective, but how do you scale it? How do you\nmeasure it?\n\nI think it’s getting better, though. Philanthropy is bringing in more people from high-performance\nbusiness environments, and they’re tilting the culture. Having a good mission is not enough. You need\na concrete objective, and you need to know how you’re going to get there.\n\n---\n\nPatti Stonesifer: OKRs allowed us to be ambitious and disciplined at the same time. When measurable\nkey results revealed a lack of progress or showed that an objective was unachievable, we reallocated the\ncapital. If the goal was to eliminate Guinea worm disease, a very ambitious top-line goal, it was\nimportant to know whether the dollars and resources were making progress against it. With OKRs, we\ncould set both quarterly and annual beats for substantial key results against such a huge objective. *\nUntil you set a really big goal, like vaccinating every child everywhere, you can’t find out which\n\nlever or mix of levers is most important. Our annual strategy reviews began with: “What is the\nobjective here? Is it eradication or is it expanding the reach of vaccines?” Then we could get more\npractical with our key results---like the 80/90 rule at the Global Alliance for Vaccines and\nImmunization, where 80 percent of districts would have 90 percent or more coverage. You need those\nkey results to align your everyday activities, and over time you keep moving them to be even more\nambitious against that really big goal.\n\nSometimes, to be honest, we were probably measuring the wrong thing. But the effort was always\nthere to hold ourselves accountable. At private foundations, where you lack a market effect to gauge\nimpact, you have to pay close attention to whether your data is getting you to the ultimate goal. We\nwere learning so fast that sometimes we had to change data sets midstream. Say you had a seed that\nwould double production of yams, and you were focused on that number. But then it turned out that\nnobody would use the seed because the yams took four times longer to cook at night. . . .\n\nSetting the big goals wasn’t as hard as breaking them down: What rocks need to be moved to\n\nachieve them? That’s one of the beauties of working with Bill and Melinda. They want to see progress,\nbut bold goals don’t faze them.\n\n---\n\nCase in point: the ongoing fight against the most lethal animal on the planet,\nthe mosquito. * In 2016, the Gates Foundation teamed with the British\ngovernment in a five-year, $4.3 billion campaign to eradicate malaria, the", "source_file": "measure-what-matters-by-john-doerr.pdf", "extraction_method": "pdfminer", "ocr_used": false, "has_table": false, "chapter_num": null, "chapter_title": null, "section_num": "0.7", "section_title": "to 1.0 = green. * (We delivered.)", "l1_summary": "I’m a huge fan of goals, but they need to be handled correctly.

Neighbors would come and use it.\n\nI remember my life as pre-phone and post-phone; that one device changed so many things. Prephone, my mother would say, “Can you see if the blood test is ready in the hospital?” I would catch a\nbus and ride to the hospital, and wait in line, and often they would tell me, “No, it isn’t ready yet, come\ntomorrow.” By the time I rode the bus home, it was a three-hour trip. Post-phone, I could simply call\nthe hospital and know the results. Now we take technology for granted, and it gets better every day. But\nfor me there were these discrete moments, before and after, that I will never forget.\n\nI read every book about computers and semiconductors that I could lay my hands on. I aspired to\nsomehow make it to Silicon Valley, which meant getting into Stanford---that was my goal, to be a part\nof all the change happening there. In a way, I think I dreamt even more fervently because so little\ntechnology was available to us. I was driven by the power of imagining.\n\nThe New Applications Platform\n\nFor five years, I worked at Applied Materials in Santa Clara, in process engineering, R&D. Sometimes\nI would need to go to Intel, and I could feel the Andy Grove culture as soon as I stepped inside the\ndoor. The company was very disciplined, down to the smallest thing. (I vaguely remember having paid\nfor each cup of coffee.) In semiconductor process engineering, you must be highly methodical in\nsetting your goals and working your way through them. So my work at Applied Materials helped me\nthink about goals in a more precise way.\n\nAs the internet continued to develop, I could see its tremendous potential. I read about everything\n\nGoogle was doing---I was passionate on the subject. I was especially excited when they launched a\nproduct called Deskbar, where you could search the web from Windows without opening the browser\n---it launched from a small window in the taskbar. It was there when you needed it, but only then.\nDeskbar was an early tool for growth, a way to bring Google to many more people.\n\nI joined Google as a product manager in 2004, when the company still revolved around search. But\n\nthat was also the year of Web 2.0 and the rise of user-generated content and AJAX. * The early web\nwas a content platform, but it was fast becoming an applications platform. We were seeing the\nbeginning of a paradigm shift on the internet, and I sensed that Google would be at the heart of it.\nMy first assignment was to expand the use and distribution of Google Toolbar, which could be\nadded to any browser to get you to Google Search. It was the right project for the right time. In just a\nfew years, we scaled up Toolbar users by more than 10x. That was when I first saw the power of an\nambitious, stretch OKR.\n\nRethinking the Browser\n\nBy then we’d set up something new for Google, a team to build client software. We had people\nworking on Firefox to help improve Mozilla’s browser.

You weren’t supposed to strive for greens on every OKR you wrote---that wouldn’t stretch\nthe team. But there was an intrinsic tension because you didn’t get hired at Google unless you were\ndriven to succeed. As a leader, you didn’t want to find yourself at the end of the quarter, standing in\nfront of the company with a big red on the screen, having to explain why and how you failed. The\npressure and discomfort of that experience made a lot of us do a lot of heroic things to avoid it. But if\nyou set your team’s objectives correctly, it was sometimes unavoidable.\n\nLarry was always good about upping the goals for the company OKRs. He used certain phrases that\n\nstuck with me. He wanted people at Google to be “uncomfortably excited.” He wanted us to have “a\nhealthy disregard for the impossible.” I tried to do the same for the products team. It took courage to\nwrite an OKR that might well fail, but there was no other way if we wanted to be great.

The company has waged a constant battle against latency, the delay in a data\ntransfer that degrades the user experience. In 2008, Larry and Sergey wrote a beautiful OKR that truly\ncaptured people’s attention: “We should make the web as fast as flipping through a magazine.” It\ninspired the whole company to think harder about how we could make things better and faster.\n\nFor the Chrome project, we created a sub-OKR to turbocharge JavaScript. The goal was to make\napplications on the web work as smoothly as downloads on a desktop. We set a moonshot goal of 10x\nimprovement and named the project “V8,” after the high-performance car engine. We were fortunate to\nfind a Danish programmer named Lars Bak, who’d built virtual machines for Sun Microsystems and\nheld more than a dozen patents. Lars is one of the great artists in his field. He came to us and said,\nwithout an ounce of bravado, “I can do something that is much, much faster.” Within four months, he\nhad JavaScript running ten times as fast as it ran on Firefox. Within two years, it was more than twenty\ntimes faster---incredible progress. (Sometimes a stretch goal is not as wildly aspirational as it may\nseem. As Lars later told Steven Levy in In the Plex , “We sort of underestimated what we could do.”)\n\nStretch OKRs are an intense exercise in problem solving. Having gone through the Toolbar journey,\n\nI had a good sense of how to work my way through the inevitable troughs. Sure, there were sleepless\nnights. But no matter how much stress I was feeling, I stayed cautiously optimistic with my team. If we\nwere losing users, I would tell them, let’s do an experiment to understand why and fix it. If\ncompatibility was an issue, I’d assign a group to focus on that. I tried to be thoughtful and systematic\nand not too emotional, and I think that helped.\n\nGoogle is propelled by our moonshot culture. The very ambitious is very hard to do. In a healthy\n\nway, our team realized that the success of Chrome would ultimately mean hundreds of millions of\nusers. Whenever we invent something new at Google, we’re always thinking: How can we scale it to a\nbillion? Early in the process, that number can seem very abstract. But when you set a measurable\nobjective for the year and chunk the problem, quarter by quarter, moonshots become more doable.\nThat’s one of the great benefits of OKRs. They give us clear, quantitative targets on the road to those\nqualitative leaps.\n\nAfter we failed against the 20 million in 2008, it made us dig deeper. We never gave up on the\nobjective, but we changed the way we framed it. Here’s what I tried to communicate: “No, we didn’t\nreach the goal, but we are laying the foundation to break through this barrier. Now, what are we going\nto do differently?” In a culture of smart people, you had better have good answers to that question; you\ncan’t tap-dance your way through. In this case, we needed a solution to one very basic problem: Why\nwas it so difficult to get people to try a new browser?\n\nThat’s how we became motivated to find new distribution deals for Chrome. Down the road, when\n\nwe found that people were unclear about just what a browser did for them, we turned to television\nmarketing to explain it. Our Chrome ads represented the largest offline campaign in the company’s\nhistory. People still remember “Dear Sophie,” * a spot created around a father’s digital scrapbook of his\ndaughter as she grew.

This is a key result.” And using the football analogy to demonstrate how\nOKRs were implemented. The other day, sorting through some files, I came across John’s presentation\n---on plastic laminate sheets for an overhead projector.

But then my kids shouted,\n“Play it again!” The light bulb went on. We saw a next-generation opportunity, a new way for people to\ncreate video for global distribution. We went about building an interface, and had our surprising first\nhit: two kids singing Backstreet Boys in their dorm room, with a roommate studying in the background.\nWe carried some professional videos, too, but the user-generated content did better.\n\nThe main flaw in Google Videos was a delay in our upload process. It broke a company rule for\nproduct development: Make it fast. User-uploaded videos weren’t immediately available to watch,\nwhereas on YouTube they were---a big problem. By the time we fixed it, we’d lost significant market\nshare. YouTube was out-streaming us three to one, but financially they were struggling. Swamped by\ndemand, they urgently needed capital to build infrastructure. It was clear they would have to sell.\n\nI saw an opportunity to combine the two services. I worked up some spreadsheets to justify the\n$1.65 billion purchase price, to show that Google could make its money back, and convinced Larry and\nSergey. At the last minute, the founders asked me to bring my spreadsheets to the board meeting. There\nwere lots of questions. The board gave us the green light, though they weren’t totally sold on my\nassumption for year-on-year user growth. And it’s funny, because rapid growth is the one thing that\nYouTube has consistently delivered to this day.\n\nBig Rocks\n\nCristos Goodrow: In February 2011, when I came over from Google Product Search, three years\nbefore Susan joined the team, YouTube’s OKRs needed work. The company---around eight hundred\npeople at the time---was producing hundreds of them each quarter. A team would open a Google doc\nand start typing in objectives, and they’d wind up with thirty or forty for ten people, and less than half\nwould actually get done.\n\nEngineers struggle with goal setting in two big ways. They hate crossing off anything they think is a\ngood idea, and they habitually underestimate how long it takes to get things done. I’d lived through this\nat Product Search, where they’d insist: “Come on, I’m a smart person. I can surely get more done than\nthat .” It took discipline for people to narrow their lists to three or four objectives for their team, but it", "source_file": "measure-what-matters-by-john-doerr.pdf", "extraction_method": "pdfminer", "ocr_used": false, "has_table": false, "chapter_num": null, "chapter_title": null, "section_num": "0.7", "section_title": "to 1.0 = green. * (We delivered.)", "l1_summary": "If You Can’t Beat ’Em .

After\nI took responsibility for search and discovery at YouTube, it only made sense to do the same thing\nthere.\n\nThen Salar Kamangar turned over day-to-day leadership for the tech side of YouTube to Shishir\nMehrotra, and Shishir helped bring focus to the whole company. He used a metaphor called the Big\nRocks Theory, which was popularized by Stephen Covey. Say you have some rocks, and a bunch of\npebbles, and some sand, and your goal is to fit as much of everything as you can into a wide-mouth,\none-gallon jar. If you start with the sand, and then the pebbles, the jar will run out of room for all the\nrocks. But when you start with the rocks, add the pebbles, and save the sand for last, the sand fills the\nspaces between the rocks---everything fits. In other words, the most important things need to get done\nfirst or they won’t get done at all.\n\nBut what were YouTube’s big rocks? People did their own things and let a thousand flowers bloom,\n\nbut no one could identify the top-level OKRs. Now leadership was saying, “All of your ideas are\nwonderful. But could we please identify a few of them as our big rocks for this quarter, and for the\nyear?” After that, everyone at YouTube knew our top priorities. All of our big rocks would make it into\nthe jar.\n\nThat was a giant step toward the goal that swallowed the next four years of my life.\n\nA Better Metric\n\nYouTube had figured out how to make money, but they still weren’t sure how to grow viewership.\nFortunately for the company and me, an engineer in Google Research Group was out in front of us. On\na dedicated team named Sibyl, Jim McFadden was building a system for selecting “watch next”\nrecommendations, aka related videos or “suggestions.” It had tremendous potential to boost our overall\nviews. But were views what we really wanted to boost?\n\nAs Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella has pointed out: In a world where computing power is nearly\nlimitless, “ the true scarce commodity is increasingly human attention.” When users spend more of their\nvaluable time watching YouTube videos, they must perforce be happier with those videos. It’s a\nvirtuous circle: More satisfied viewership (watch time) begets more advertising, which incentivizes\nmore content creators, which draws more viewership.\n\nOur true currency wasn’t views or clicks---it was watch time. The logic was undeniable. YouTube\n\nneeded a new core metric.\n\nWatch Time, and Only Watch Time\n\nIn September 2011, I sent a provocative email to my boss and the YouTube leadership team. Subject\nline: “Watch time, and only watch time.” It was a call to rethink how we measured success: “All other\nthings being equal, our goal is to increase [video] watch time.” For many folks at Google, it smacked of\nheresy. Google Search was designed as a switchboard to route you off the site and out to your best\ndestination as quickly as possible.

Last\n(but not least), to optimize for watch time would incur a significant money hit, at least at the start. Since\nYouTube ads were shown exclusively before videos started, fewer starts meant fewer ads. Fewer ads\nmeant less revenue. *\n\nMy argument was that Google and YouTube were different animals. To make the dichotomy as\nstark as possible, I made up a scenario: A user goes to YouTube and types the query “How do I tie a\nbow tie?” And we have two videos on the topic. The first is one minute long and teaches you very\nquickly and precisely how to tie a bow tie. The second is ten minutes long and is full of jokes and really\nentertaining, and at the end of it you may or may not know how to tie a bow tie. I’d ask my colleagues:\nWhich video should be ranked as our first search result?\n\nFor those at Google Search, the answer was easy: “The first one, of course. If people come to\n\nYouTube to tie a bow tie, we surely want to help them tie a bow tie.”\n\nAnd I’d say, “I want to show them the second video.”\nAnd the Search cohort would protest, “Why would you do that? These poor people just want to tie\ntheir bow ties and get to their event!” (They were probably thinking: This guy’s insane.) But my point\nwas that YouTube’s mission was fundamentally divergent. It’s fine for viewers to learn to tie bow ties,\nand if that’s all they want, they’ll choose the one-minute manual. But that’s not what YouTube was\nabout, not really. Our job was to keep people engaged and hanging out with us. By definition, viewers\nare happier watching seven minutes of a ten-minute video (or even two minutes of a ten-minute video)\nthan all of a one-minute video. And when they’re happier, we are, too.\n\nIt took six months, but I won the argument. On the Ides of March, 2012, we launched a watch-timeoptimized version of our recommendation algorithm aimed at improving user engagement and\nsatisfaction. Our new focus would make YouTube a more user-friendly platform, particularly for\nmusic, how-to videos, and entertainment and late-night comedy clips.\n\nA Big Round Number\n\nIn November 2012, at our annual YouTube Leadership Summit in Los Angeles, Shishir gathered a few\nof us together. He said he was about to announce a big stretch goal to kick off the coming year: one\nbillion hours in daily user watch time. (There is power in simplicity, and round numbers are simple.)\nHe asked us, “When can we get this done? What’s the time frame?” A billion hours represented a 10x\nincrease, and we knew it would take years, not months. We thought 2015 was too soon, and 2017\nsounded weird. (Prime numbers, in general, sound weird.) Just before Shishir took the stage, we settled\non the end of 2016, a four-year OKR with a set of rolling, annual objectives and quarterly, incremental\nkey results.\n\nOBJECTIVE\n\nReach 1 billion hours of watch time per day [by 2016], with growth driven\nby:\n\n1.

That’s where the art of framing\ncomes in. Clever manager that he is, Shishir cut our BHAG down to size. While one billion daily hours\nsounded like an awful lot, it represented less than 20 percent of the world’s total television watch time.\nIntroducing that context was helpful and clarifying, at least for me. We weren’t gunning to be\narbitrarily big. Rather: There was another thing out there way bigger than us, and we were trying to\nscale up to it.\n\nIn pursuing our mission over the next four years, we weren’t 10x absolutists. In fact, we’d commit\nto some watch-time-negative decisions for the benefit of our users. For example, we made it a policy to\nstop recommending trashy, tabloid-style videos---like “World’s Worst Parents,” where the thumbnail\nshowed a baby in a pot on the stove. Three weeks in, the move proved negative for watch time by half a\npercent. We stood by our decision because it was better for the viewer experience, cut down on click\nbait, and reflected our principle of growing responsibly. Three months in, watch time in this group had\nbounced back and actually increased. Once the gruesome stuff became less accessible, people sought\nout more satisfying content.\n\nOnce the billion-hour BHAG was set, however, we never did anything without measuring impact on\n\nwatch time. If a change might slow our progress, we’d be scrupulous about estimating just how much.\nThen we’d build internal consensus before going through with it.\n\nGetting Up to Speed\n\nSusan: Salar Kamangar most enjoys the earlier stages of companies. He likes taking them to the next\nlevel; he’s really good at that. By 2012, YouTube had grown into a big organization, and Salar decided\nto move on. The company had split into two factions, business and technology, and needed someone to\nbring them together. After leading AdWords for a decade, I was used to complex ecosystems. I was\neager to take on the challenge of unifying YouTube.\n\nWhen YouTube leadership set the one-billion-hour daily watch time goal, most of our people\njudged it impossible. They thought it would break the internet! But it seemed to me that such a clear\nand measurable objective would energize people, and I cheered them on.\n\nBy February 2014, when I came over, YouTube was nearly a third of the way through the four-year,\n\nmega-stretch OKR. But while the objective was well planted, it wasn’t quite on pace. Watch-time\ngrowth had dropped significantly below what we needed to make our deadline, a source of stress for all\ninvolved. While Google aims for a grade of 0.7 (or 70 percent attainment) on stretch goals in aggregate,\nand there are times people totally fail, no team goes into an OKR saying, “Let’s settle for 70 percent", "source_file": "measure-what-matters-by-john-doerr.pdf", "extraction_method": "pdfminer", "ocr_used": false, "has_table": false, "chapter_num": null, "chapter_title": null, "section_num": "0.7", "section_title": "to 1.0 = green. * (We delivered.)", "l1_summary": "Grow kids’ engagement and gaming watch time (X watch hours per day).

It’s safe to say that no one at YouTube would have been satisfied to reach 700 million daily\nwatch-time hours.\n\nIn all honesty, though, I wasn’t certain we’d reach the billion hours on time. I thought it would be\n\nokay if we missed by a little bit, as long as everyone stayed united and aligned. I’d seen us miss\nobjectives at Google, and we’d renew our focus and roll them forward. In 2007, when we introduced\nAdSense to monetize the whole web, the launch was a quarterly OKR. We worked really hard to\nrelease it to the actual day but wound up two days late. No harm was done.\n\nMaybe the best thing about OKRs is how they track your progress to a target, especially when\nyou’re behind schedule. When I ran Google’s mid-quarter OKR updates, the point was to figure out\nhow to fix things and get back on track. The updates were opportunities to gather the leadership team\nand say, “Okay, I want each of you to name five projects you can implement to bring us closer to our\ngoal.” We’d extend the OKR and promote positive behavior. So I wasn’t super-worried about hitting\nthe billion hours before the clock struck twelve.\n\nCristos Goodrow, the OKR’s guardian, had another perspective. The billion daily hours had become\n\nhis white whale. Not long after I joined the company, at our “up-to-speed” meeting, Cristos presented\nme with a deck of forty-six slides. By number five, he’d made his point loud and clear: We needed to\ncatch up.\n\nCristos: I was very concerned. Each year we announced our annual objectives and areas of focus.\nFrom 2013 through 2016, the billion-hour OKR headlined the presentation. We also had clear interim\nmilestones to stay on track. When I first met with Susan, I thanked her for keeping our 10x goal. Then I\nsaid, “By the way, we’re way behind. I’m freaked out and I hope that you’re at least a little freaked out.\nAnd when you’re making decisions about what to prioritize and where to lean, please keep in mind that\nwe are not going to meet this watch-time OKR if we don’t do something about it.”\n\nSusan: I had some pressing concerns. One was a rearguard action with Google’s machine people, to\nmake sure we had the infrastructure to support our goal. It takes a flood of bytes to get YouTube videos\nfrom our data centers to the user, way more than what’s required for email or social media. (The\ntechnical term is “egress bandwidth.”) We do everything we can to guarantee in advance that Google\nwill have enough servers to route all those bytes to deliver your cat video to your phone or laptop.\n\nAfter announcing the billion-hour OKR, YouTube’s leadership team went on a charm offensive to\nreserve the bandwidth we’d need through 2016. When I took the reins, Google’s server group asked to\nrenegotiate what must have seemed like an exorbitant spend. I was in a tough spot: I was new, and we\nwere lagging our projected usage. But if we cut back on our machines, I knew it wouldn’t be easy to\nrecover. So I kicked the can down the road. I said to those high-powered technical people, “Let’s just\nstay with the plan for now and meet again in three months.” I wanted to hang on to our reservations\nuntil we knew where things stood. Three months later, we had more data and more growth and an\neasier case to make.\n\nThe billion-hour OKR was a religion at YouTube, to the exclusion of nearly all else. It’s important\nto respect people’s religion, and I wanted to support that big stretch goal. But it was so black-and-white\nthat I feared it could be detrimental if not properly managed. My job was to keep an eye on the gray,\nthe nuances that might get overlooked. Daily watch time is driven by two factors: the average number\nof daily active viewers (or DAVs) and the average amount of time those viewers spend watching.\nYouTube was doing a good job on the second variable---but that was lower-hanging fruit.

In a collective effort to move the\ncompany forward, managers, employees, and peers join in multiple Check-in\nconversations each year. Instead of falling back on the HR team, leaders\nthroughout the organization take proactive ownership of the process.\n\nLightweight, flexible, and transparent, with minimal structure and no\ntracking or paperwork, Check-in features three focus areas: quarterly “goals\nand expectations” (Adobe’s term for OKRs), regular feedback, and career\ndevelopment and growth. Sessions are called by contributors and decoupled\nfrom compensation. Forced-distribution stack rankings have been replaced by\nan annual Rewards Check-in. Managers are trained to scale compensation\nbased on employees’ performance, their impact on the business, the relative\nscarcity of their skills, and market conditions. There are no fixed guidelines.\nSince the fall of 2012, when Check-in was installed, Adobe’s voluntary\n\nattrition has dropped sharply.

Instead, what if you all knew what was expected\nof you and had the opportunity to grow your career at Adobe, where each of you is so valued?\n\nCheck-in has helped us to live Adobe’s values every day. To explain how the new process worked,\nwe kicked it off with the first of a series of thirty-to-sixty-minute web training conferences. We rolled\nthem out to senior leaders, then managers, then employees. (We had a 90 percent employee\nparticipation rate.) Each quarter we’ve addressed a different phase of Check-in, from setting\nexpectations to giving and receiving feedback.\n\nWe’ve also invested in an employee resource center, which offers templates and videos to help our\npeople build their constructive feedback skill set. Adobe has a lot of engineers who weren’t necessarily\nexperienced with open dialogue. The center has helped them ease into the process.\n\nOur leaders role-modeled Check-in. They needed to show they were open to feedback themselves,\n\nand comfortable being questioned on their vision.\n\nNow we treat every manager as a business leader. They are allocated budgets for base incentives\nand equity, a pool of money to be distributed as they see fit. It’s super-empowering for them to know\nthey are truly responsible for their reports.

{"segment_id": "00151", "page_num": 151, "segment": "Achieving What’s Real\n\nAlex Garden: It’s hard to deny the explicit value of OKRs, like how they help tie an organization to\nthe leadership’s true ambitions. But for young companies like Zume, especially, there’s an equally\nimportant implicit value that gets overlooked. OKRs are a superb training tool for executives and\nmanagers. They teach you how to manage your business within existing limits. It’s important to push\nthe envelope, but the envelope is real. Everybody faces resource constraints: time, money, people. And\nthe bigger an organization, the more entropy---it’s like thermodynamics. During my stint as a general\nmanager at Microsoft’s Xbox Live, I worked with some visionary executives. But we struggled from a\nmisalignment between the leaders’ desires and the capabilities of the organization. The “hows”---and\nmost of the “whats,” as well---were left to me and some other divisional foot soldiers. It was our job to\nexecute an impractically framed mandate for an overscoped mission. If we’d had a well-constructed\ngoal-setting process from the start, it might have saved everyone a lot of grief.\n\nOld-school business models suggest that your role as an executive gets more abstract as you rise in\nthe ranks. Your middle managers buffer you from the operational day-to-day, freeing you to focus on\nthe big picture. Maybe that worked in a slower-paced era. But in my experience, OKRs can’t be\neffective unless the people at the top are unconditionally committed---like a religious calling. And\nproselytizing is hard and thankless work. Your people may not like you very much through the\nadoption curve, which can take up to a year. But it’s worth it.\n\nBetter Discipline\n\nJulia: If we’re talking about the intrinsic value of OKRs, what comes before anything is the discipline\nthat they instill in us as co-CEOs.\n\nAlex: They train us to be thoughtful about what we can actually achieve, and to instill the same\n\noutlook in our executive team and their teams. Early on in your career, when you’re an individual\ncontributor, you’re graded on the volume and quality of your work. Then one day, all of a sudden,\nyou’re a manager. Let’s assume you do well and move up to manage more and more people. Now\nyou’re no longer paid for the amount of work you do; you’re paid for the quality of decisions you\nmake. But no one tells you the rules have changed. When you hit a wall, you think, I’ll just work harder\n---that’s what got me here.\n\nWhat you should do is more counterintuitive: Stop for a moment and shut out the noise. Close your\n\neyes to really see what’s in front of you, and then pick the best way forward for you and your team,\nrelative to the organization’s needs. What’s neat about OKRs is that they formalize reflection. At least\nonce each quarter, they make contributors step back into a quiet place and consider how their decisions\nalign with the company. People start thinking in the macro. They become more pointed and precise,\nbecause you can’t write a ninety-page OKR dissertation. You have to choose three to five things and\nexactly how they should be measured. Then when the day comes and someone says, “Okay, you’re a\nmanager,” you’ve already learned how to think like one.

They mint stronger executives and help them avoid rookie mistakes.\n\nThey implant the rigor and rhythm of a very large company into the framework of a very small\ncompany. When we implemented OKRs at Zume, the immediate benefit was the process itself. The\nsimple act of forcing people to think about the business---thoughtfully, transparently, interdependently\n---was a huge accelerant to their performance.\n\nBetter Engagement\n\nAlex: OKRs take out the ambiguity. And when you do that, some people will say, “This isn’t what I\nthought I signed up for, and I’m leaving.” But others will say, “I’m inspired because I finally know\nwhat we’re trying to do.” Either way, there’s clarity. For those who stay, you’ve laid the foundation for\nengagement. Everybody’s bought in to the mission. Team sports don’t work unless the whole team\nplays together.\n\nJulia: As people get more familiar with the OKR process, it naturally gets more collaborative. In\nQ3 of 2016, Alex and I wrote the top company OKRs, and the department heads converted some of our\nkey results into their own objectives. We just cascaded them down. In Q4, the two of us still wrote the\ncompany objectives, but our team jumped in and KRed them from the top, which was great. They took\non a more creative role, and the OKRs got better.

Your objectives will get their turn\nup on the screen, like everyone else’s, for comment and support.\n\nI’d add that a really good company values different opinions.

That’s how we foster a meritocracy.\n\nAlex: Before rolling OKRs out to our individual contributors, we put in two full quarters at the exec\n\nlevel. We had to establish the culture first.

When Alex and\nI saw their confusion, we broke the objective out into new revenue (marketing) and repeat revenue\n(product), and the department heads drilled down from there. That was an important conversation. It\nwasn’t linked to an objective, per se, but it was absolutely a by-product of an early-stage OKR process.\nWhen something isn’t clearly delineated, it shows up right away. You can’t miss it.\n\nBetter Teamwork\n\nAlex: In eight months we launched a food company, a logistics company, a robotics company, and a\nmanufacturing company---from a standing start.
