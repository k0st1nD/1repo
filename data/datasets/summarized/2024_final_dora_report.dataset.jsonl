With this\ncomplexity in mind, how can we use the\nsoftware delivery performance metrics\nto help guide our improvement efforts?\n\nStart by identifying the primary\napplication or service you would\nlike to measure and improve. We then\nrecommend gathering the crossfunctional team responsible for this\napplication to measure and agree\non its current software delivery\nperformance. The DORA Quick Check\n(https://dora.dev/quickcheck) can\nhelp guide a conversation and set\nthis baseline measurement.

What lessons\nhave you learned?\n\nRepeating this process will help the\nteam build a practice of continuous\nimprovement.\n\nRemember: change does not happen\novernight. An iterative approach that\nenables a climate for learning, fast flow,\nand fast feedback6 is required.\n\n1.\n\n We consider a deployment to be a change failure only if it causes an issue after landing in production, where it can be experienced\nby end users.

Product performance, however, does\nnot seem to have an obvious association\nwith AI adoption. Now, we can shift to\ntrying to understand what is underlying\nthese effects.\n\nWe hypothesize that the factors\ncontributing to strong team and\norganizational performance differ from\nthose influencing product performance.\n\nTeams and organizations rely heavily\non communication, knowledge sharing,\ndecision making, and healthy culture. AI\ncould be alleviating some bottlenecks in\nthose areas, beneficially impacting teams\nand the organizations.\n\nProduct success, however, might involve\nadditional factors. Although good\nproducts surely have similar underlying\ncauses as good high performing teams\nand organizations, there is likely a closer\nand more direct connection to the\ndevelopment workflow and the software\ndelivery, both of which may be still\nstabilizing after the introduction of AI.\n\nThe unique importance of technical\naspects underlying a good product\nmight explain part of it, but there is\nalso an art and empathy underlying a\ngreat product. This might be difficult to\nbelieve for people who think everything\n\nis a problem to be resolved through\ncomputation, but certain elements of\nproduct development, such as creativity\nor user experience design, may still (or\nforever) heavily rely on human intuition\nand expertise.\n\nThe fact remains that organization,\nteam, and product performance are\nundeniably interconnected. When looking\nat bivariate correlations (Pearson), we\nfind product performance has a medium\npositive correlation with both team\nperformance (r = 0.56, 95% confidence\ninterval = 0.51 to 0.60) and organizational\nperformance (r = 0.47, 95% confidence\ninterval = 0.41 to 0.53).\n\nThese outcomes influence each\nother reciprocally, creating clear\ninterdependencies.

That isn’t\nto say that platforms lead to burnout,\nbut the combination of instability and\nplatforms are particularly troublesome\nwhen it comes to burnout. Similar to\nthe decrease in throughput, we aren’t\nentirely sure why the change in burnout\noccurs, but we have some hypotheses.\n\nFirst, the platform enables developers\nand teams to push changes with a higher\ndegree of confidence that if the change\nis bad, it can be quickly remediated. In\nthis instance the higher level of instability\nisn’t necessarily a bad thing since\nthe platform is empowering teams to\nexperiment and deliver changes, which\nresults in an increased level of change\nfailure and rework.\n\nA second idea is that the platform\nisn’t effective at ensuring the quality\nof changes and/or deployments\nto production.\n\nIt could also be that the platform\nprovides an automated testing\ncapability that exercises whatever tests\nare included in the application. Yet\napplication teams aren't fully using that\ncapability by prioritizing throughput over\nquality and not improving their tests.\nIn either scenario, bad changes are\nactually making it through the process,\nresulting in rework.\n\nA third possibility is that teams with\na high level of change instability and\nburnout tend to create platforms in an\neffort to improve stability and reduce\nburnout. This makes sense because\nplatform engineering is often viewed\nas a practice which reduces burnout\nand increases the ability to consistently\nship smaller changes. With this\nhypothesis, platform engineering is\nsymptomatic of an organization with\nburnout and change instability.\n\nIn the first two scenarios, the rework\nallowed by the platform could be seen\nas burdensome which could also be\nincreasing burnout. In particular, the\nsecond scenario where the platform is\nenabling bad changes would contribute\nmore to burnout, but in both scenarios\nthe team or individual could still feel\nproductive because of their ability to\npush changes and features.

There are two broad\nways to analyze the validity of these\nmeasures: internally and externally.\n\nwhen they’re happy. We assume that\nhappiness is underlying a certain pattern\nof feelings, thoughts, and action.\n\nTherefore, we expect certain types\nof feelings, thoughts, and actions to\nemerge together when happiness is\npresent. We would then ask questions\nabout these feelings, thoughts, and\nactions. We would use confirmatory\nfactor analysis to test whether they\nactually do show up together.\n\nTo understand the internal validity\nof the measure, we look at what we think\nindicates the presence of a concept.\nFor example, quality documentation\nmight be indicated by people using their\ndocumentation to solve problems.\n\nThis year we used the lavaan1 R package\nto do this analysis. Lavaan returns\na variety of fit statistics that help us\nunderstand whether constructs\nactually represent the way people\nanswer the questions.\n\nA majority of our variables consist\nof multiple indicators because the\nconstructs we’re interested in appear\nto be multifaceted.\n\nTo understand the multifaceted nature of\na variable, we test how well the items we\nuse to represent that concept gel. If they\ngel well (that is, they share a high level\nof communal variance), we assume that\nsomething underlies them---such as the\nconcept of interest.\n\nThink of happiness, for example,\nhappiness is multifaceted. We expect\nsomeone to feel a certain way, act a\ncertain way, and think a certain way\n\nIf the indicators of a concept don't gel,\nthe concepts might need to be revised\nor dropped because it’s clear that we\nhaven't found a reliable way to measure\nthe concept.\n\nThe external validity of a construct is\nall about looking at how the construct\nfits into the world. We might expect a\nconstruct to have certain relationships to\nother constructs. Sometimes we might\nexpect two constructs to have a negative\nrelationship, like happiness and sadness.\n\nIf our happiness measure comes back\npositively correlated with sadness, we\nmight question our measure or our theory.\n\n103\n\nMethodology\n\nv. 2024.3", "source_file": "2024_final_dora_report.pdf", "extraction_method": "pdfminer", "ocr_used": false, "has_table": false, "chapter_num": null, "chapter_title": null, "section_num": null, "section_title": null, "l1_summary": "We assume that\nhappiness is underlying a certain pattern\nof feelings, thoughts, and action.

This then means that our\nmeasures are not calibrated enough\nto pick up on the differences between\nthe two concepts, or the difference we\nhypothesized isn’t actually there.\n\nModel evaluation\n\nUsing a set of hypotheses as our guiding\nprinciple, we build hypothetical models,\nlittle toys that try to capture some aspect\nabout how the world works.
