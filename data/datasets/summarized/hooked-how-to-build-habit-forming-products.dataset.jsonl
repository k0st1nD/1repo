By mastering habit-forming product design, the\ncompanies profiled in this book make their goods indispensable.\n\nFIRST TO MIND WINS\n\nCompanies that form strong user habits enjoy several benefits to their bottom\nline. These companies attach their product to internal triggers. As a result,\nusers show up without any external prompting.\n\nInstead of relying on expensive marketing, habit-forming companies link\n\ntheir services to the users’ daily routines and emotions.7 A habit is at work\nwhen users feel a tad bored and instantly open Twitter. They feel a pang of\nloneliness and before rational thought occurs, they are scrolling through their\nFacebook feeds. A question comes to mind and before searching their brains,\nthey query Google. The first-to-mind solution wins. In chapter 1 of this book,\nwe explore the competitive advantages of habit-forming products.\n\nHow do products create habits? The answer: They manufacture them.\n\nWhile fans of the television show Mad Men are familiar with how the ad\nindustry once created consumer desire during Madison Avenue’s golden era,\nthose days are long gone. A multiscreen world of ad-wary consumers has\nrendered Don Draper’s big-budget brainwashing useless to all but the biggest\nbrands.\n\nToday, small start-up teams can profoundly change behavior by guiding\nusers through a series of experiences I call hooks. The more often users run\nthrough these hooks, the more likely they are to form habits.\n\nHow I Got Hooked\n\nIn 2008 I was among a team of Stanford MBAs starting a company backed\nby some of the brightest investors in Silicon Valley.

Triggers\ncome in two types: external and internal.8 Habit-forming products start by\nalerting users with external triggers like an e-mail, a Web site link, or the app\nicon on a phone.\n\nFor example, suppose Barbra, a young woman in Pennsylvania, happens\nto see a photo in her Facebook News Feed taken by a family member from a\nrural part of the state. It’s a lovely picture and because she is planning a trip\nthere with her brother Johnny, the external trigger’s call to action (in\nmarketing and advertising lingo) intrigues her and she clicks. By cycling\nthrough successive hooks, users begin to form associations with internal\ntriggers, which attach to existing behaviors and emotions.\n\nWhen users start to automatically cue their next behavior, the new habit\n\nbecomes part of their everyday routine.

However, add some variability to the mix---suppose a\ndifferent treat magically appears in your fridge every time you open it---and\nvoilà, intrigue is created.\n\nVariable rewards are one of the most powerful tools companies\n\nimplement to hook users; chapter 4 explains them in further detail. Research\nshows that levels of the neurotransmitter dopamine surge when the brain is\nexpecting a reward.11 Introducing variability multiplies the effect, creating a\nfocused state, which suppresses the areas of the brain associated with\njudgment and reason while activating the parts associated with wanting and\ndesire.12 Although classic examples include slot machines and lotteries,\nvariable rewards are prevalent in many other habit-forming products.\n\nWhen Barbra lands on Pinterest, not only does she see the image she\nintended to find, but she is also served a multitude of other glittering objects.\nThe images are related to what she is generally interested in---namely things\nto see on her upcoming trip to rural Pennsylvania---but there are other things\nthat catch her eye as well.

Entrepreneurs\nshould evaluate how user habits impact their particular business model and\ngoals. While the viability of some products depends on habit-formation to\nthrive, that is not always the case.\n\nFor example, companies selling infrequently bought or used products or\nservices do not require habitual users---at least, not in the sense of everyday\nengagement.

For an infrequent action to become a habit, the\nuser must perceive a high degree of utility, either from gaining pleasure or\navoiding pain.\n\nTake Amazon as an example: The e-tailer has its sights set on becoming\n\nthe world’s one-stop shop. Amazon is so confident in its ability to form user\nhabits that it sells and runs ads for directly competitive products on its site.19\nCustomers often see the item they are about to buy listed at a cheaper price\nand can click away to transact elsewhere. To some, this sounds like a formula\nfor disaster. But to Amazon, it is a shrewd business strategy.\n\nNot only does Amazon make money from the ads it runs from competing\nbusinesses, it also utilizes other companies’ marketing dollars to form a habit\nin the shopper’s mind. Amazon seeks to become the solution to a frequently\noccurring pain point---the customer’s desire to find the items they want.\n\nBy addressing shoppers’ price concerns, Amazon earns loyalty even if it\ndoesn’t make the sale and comes across as trustworthy in the process. The\ntactic is backed by a 2003 study, which demonstrated that consumers’\npreference for an online retailer increases when they are offered competitive\nprice information.20 The technique has also been used by Progressive, the car\ninsurance company, to drive over $15 billion of annual insurance sales, up", "source_file": "Hooked-How-to-Build-Habit-Forming-Products.pdf", "extraction_method": "pdfminer", "ocr_used": false, "has_table": false, "chapter_num": null, "chapter_title": null, "section_num": null, "section_title": null, "l1_summary": "If a user is familiar with the Google interface, switching to Bing\nrequires cognitive effort. as the one and only solution in the habituated user’s mind.

The allure that\nsomeone just sent you money was a huge incentive to open an account, and\nPayPal’s growth spread because it was both viral and useful.\n\nUnfortunately, some companies utilize viral loops and relationship\ntriggers in unethical ways: by deploying so-called dark patterns. When\ndesigners intentionally trick users into inviting friends or blasting a message\nto their social networks, they may see some initial growth, but it comes at the\nexpense of users’ goodwill and trust.

For instance, Yin often uses Instagram when she\nfears a special moment will be lost forever.\n\nThe severity of the discomfort may be relatively minor---perhaps her fear\nis below the perceptibility of consciousness---but that’s exactly the point. Our\nlife is filled with tiny stressors and we’re usually unaware of our habitual\nreactions to these nagging issues.\n\nPositive emotions can also serve as internal triggers, and may even be\ntriggered themselves by a need to satisfy something that is bothering us.

A need to share\ngood news can also be thought of as an attempt to find and maintain social\nconnections.\n\nAs product designers it is our goal to solve these problems and eliminate\npain---to scratch the user’s itch. Users who find a product that alleviates their\npain will form strong, positive associations with the product over time. After\ncontinued use, bonds begin to form---like the layers of nacre in an oyster---\nbetween the product and the user whose need it satisfies.\n\nGradually, these bonds cement into a habit as users turn to your\nproduct when experiencing certain internal triggers.\n\nA study at the Missouri University of Science and Technology illustrates\n\nhow tech solutions can provide frequent psychological relief.6 In 2011 a\ngroup of 216 undergraduates volunteered to have their Internet activity\nanonymously tracked.

Dr. Edward Deci, Professor of Psychology at the University of\nRochester and a leading researcher on the self-determination theory, defines\nmotivation as “the energy for action.”2\n\nThe nature of motivation is a widely contested topic in psychology, but\n\nFogg argues that three Core Motivators drive our desire to act.\n\nFogg states that all humans are motivated to seek pleasure and avoid\npain; to seek hope and avoid fear; and finally, to seek social acceptance and\navoid rejection. The two sides of the three Core Motivators can be thought of\nas levers to increase or decrease the likelihood of someone’s taking a\nparticular action by increasing or decreasing that person’s motivation.", "source_file": "Hooked-How-to-Build-Habit-Forming-Products.pdf", "extraction_method": "pdfminer", "ocr_used": false, "has_table": false, "chapter_num": null, "chapter_title": null, "section_num": null, "section_title": null, "l1_summary": "Your lack of motivation influenced you to ignore the\ncall. the other two components of the Fogg Behavior Model: motivation and\nability.

F. Skinner conducted experiments to understand\nhow variability impacted animal behavior.5 First, Skinner placed pigeons\ninside a box rigged to deliver a food pellet to the birds every time they\npressed a lever. Similar to Olds’s and Milner’s lab mice, the pigeons learned\nthe cause-and-effect relationship between pressing the lever and receiving the\nfood.\n\nIn the next part of the experiment Skinner added variability.

For example, during an\nepisode in the first season, Walter White must find a way to dispose of the\nbodies of two rival drug dealers. Challenges prevent resolution of the conflict\nand suspense is created as the audience waits to find out how the story line\nends. In this particular episode White discovers one of the drug dealers is still\nalive and is faced with the dilemma of having to kill someone he thought was\nalready dead. Invariably, each episode’s central conflict is resolved near the\nend of the show, at which time a new challenge arises to pique the viewer’s\ncuriosity. By design, the only way to know how Walter gets out of the mess\nhe is in at the end of the latest episode is to watch the next episode.\n\nThe cycle of conflict, mystery, and resolution is as old as storytelling\n\nitself, and at the heart of every good tale is variability.

We empathize with characters because they are driven by\nthe same things that drive us.\n\nYet if the search to resolve uncertainty is such a powerful tool of\nengagement, why do we eventually lose interest in the things that once\nriveted us? Many people have experienced the intense focus of being hooked\non a TV series, a great book, a new video game, or even the latest gadget.\nHowever, most of us lose interest in a few days’ or weeks’ time. Why does\nthe power of variable rewards seem to fade away?\n\nPerhaps no company in recent memory epitomizes the mercurial nature of\n\nvariable rewards quite like Zynga, makers of the hit Facebook game\nFarmVille. In 2009 FarmVille undeniably became part of the global zeitgeist.\nThe game smashed records as it quickly reached 83.8 million monthly active\nusers by leveraging the Facebook platform to acquire new players.29 In 2010,\nas “farmers” tended their digital crops while paying real money for virtual\ngoods and levels, the company generated more than $36 million in revenue.30\nThe company seemed invincible and set a course for growth by cloning\n\nits FarmVille success into a franchise. Zynga soon released CityVille,\nChefVille, FrontierVille, and several more -Ville titles using familiar game\nmechanics in the hope that people would enjoy them as voraciously as they\nhad FarmVille. By March 2012 Zynga’s stock was flying high and the\ncompany was valued at over $10 billion.\n\nYet by November of that same year, the stock was down over 80 percent.\n\nIt turned out that Zynga’s new games were not really new at all. The\ncompany had simply done retreads of FarmVille; players had lost interest and\ninvestors followed suit. What was once novel and intriguing became rote and\nboring.

There is no immediate reward for following someone, no stars or\nbadges to affirm the action. Following is an investment in the service, which\nincreases the likelihood of the user checking Twitter in the future.\n\nAlso in contrast to the action phase, the investment phase increases\nfriction. This certainly breaks conventional thinking in the product design\ncommunity that all user experiences should be as easy and effortless as\npossible. This approach still generally holds true, as does my advice in the\naction phase to make the intended actions as simple as possible. In the\ninvestment phase, however, asking users to do a bit of work comes after users\nhave received variable rewards, not before. The timing of asking for user\ninvestment is critically important. By asking for the investment after the\nreward, the company has an opportunity to leverage a central trait of human\nbehavior.\n\nIn an experiment conducted by Stanford researchers, two groups of\npeople were asked to complete a task with the help of computers.7 The\nparticipants were initially asked to use their assigned computers to answer a\nseries of questions. The computers provided to the first group were helpful\nwhen answering participants’ questions, while those provided to the second\ngroup were programmed to be unhelpful, offering unclear answers. After\ncompleting the task, participants then switched roles and the machines began\nasking the people for assistance with their questions.\n\nThe study found that the group given helpful computers performed almost\ntwice as much work for their machines. The results showed that reciprocation\nis not just a characteristic expressed between people, but also a trait observed\nwhen humans interact with machines. Conceivably, we humans evolved the\ntendency to reciprocate kindness because it improved our species’ ability to\nsurvive. As it turns out, we invest in products and services for the same\nreasons we put effort into our relationships.\n\nThe big idea behind the investment phase is to leverage the user’s\n\nunderstanding that the service will get better with use (and personal\ninvestment). Like a good friendship, the more effort people put in, the more\nboth parties benefit.\n\nStoring Value\n\nUnlike physical goods in the real world, the software that runs our technology\nproducts can adapt itself to our needs.

YouVersion was designed to be used by\neveryone, every day,” Gruenewald says, attributing much of the app’s\nsuccess to a relentless focus on creating habitual Bible readers. The Bible\nApp’s success is broken down into the language of habit formation more\ncommonly seen in psychology textbooks.
